      <p>i can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune</p>
      <p>hey gang. i'm supposed to be writing a three-paragraph essay for some theology assignment, but it includes watching a 10-minute-long video and i just do not feel like sitting through that. trust me, i've heard enough middle-aged men telling me about jesus christ and how much ballin' he partakes in. plus, i don't want any religious bullcrap showing up on my recommended, so i'll just make up something and call it a day. if my teacher asks where my information comes from, i'll just use the handy "source: trust me bro"</p>
      <p>george 1 and a half: plus 0 progress is going fairly well, i'm starting to adapt the usage of in-game cutscenes because animated cutscenes take a while to make, and they also add <i>a lot</i> to the asset count. after i wrap up the level art for level 1, i'll probably get the framework for bosses sorted out, and i'll proceed to level 2 design. i've had plenty of ideas for trailers and music to go along with said trailers for a while now, so i might end up making a teaser trailer for you all soon. it could take a while, though, so don't get your hopes up just yet</p>
      <p>the announcement and release of the official <a href="https://www.betterthanadventure.net/">bta website</a> intrigued me, especially since it's been almost 3 years since the mod's conception. the website itself is very polished and neatly designed, even featuring the cute, yet informative artwork of one of the community's most prominent artists. the launch, however, wasn't exactly smooth, mainly because the website basically had a mini-DDoS attack from the flood of people clicking on the same link simultaneously</p>
      <p>i actually thought about giving this web site another redesign, but then i remembered that i'm fairly mid at CSS and don't exactly know how keyframes work. although i <i>am</i> taking a web design course next year, i don't think i'll make any major design changes to the site until i feel ready to announce one (and get feedback on prototype designs, of course). the next thing i'll do is probably fulfill that "secret CSS test page" i proposed a little while back, you'll just have to find it on your own when i eventually make it public ;)</p>
