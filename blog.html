    <div class="main"><h3>BLOG</h3>
    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>The most recent blog post is shown right below, and the rest can be found in the Blog Backlog.</p></div>
    
    <div class="secondary"><h3>blockdead / <i>2/3/2024</i> / <i>5:02 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>oof. today was kinda rough in terms of game-making, but some other stuff happened, too</p>
    <p>today, me and that friend i mentioned the other day were working together on a new project. it was going fairly well until blocklive, which is the service that allows people to work together on scratch, decided to shoot itself in the foot and die on us. costumes were appearing in random sprites, music failed to upload, it was a mess. worst part? <i>i couldn't even save the project</i>, meaning that any changes i made would vanish as soon as the project reloaded.</p>
    <p>it was pissing me off, and my friend couldn't even do anything about it (<i>i</i> was the one making the actual levels that time), but he had an idea. he copied the entire project and shared it to me via blocklive. it worked... for about 10 seconds, then i couldn't save again. yippee. after this, we called it quits and gave up on blocklive, praying that its eventual website would fix it</p>
    <p>yesterday it was working fine, but today it was just miserable doing the game-making. i don't know the inner workings of blocklive, but what me and my friend (mainly just me) had to go through today was just unacceptable. for now, i'll just get back to playing bta and working on my next (personal) project, which i think you'll all enjoy</p>
    <p>on a more positive note, i've been gathering a bunch more CDs from my parents' absolutely ginormous supply of them. found <i>every</i> album from The Strokes, three Tame Impala albums (Slow Rush not included), two Vampire Weekend albums, and a bunch of Beck albums. pretty cool stuff, i'll be listening to it all throughout the weekend. sorry about me going on and on about artists you've never heard of, but you should expect me to talk a lot about them here.</div>
