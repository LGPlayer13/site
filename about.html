    <p>This is where you can find all the info about me you could ever mentally store (and plenty more).</p>
    <p>Info about me and the wacky stuff I do is on top, info about this site and how dated it looks is below.</p></div>
    
    <div class="secondary"><h3>INFO ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>Good morning. I'm LG (he/him), some kid who likes to make bad Scratch and IGM games in my freetime, often trying to balance gaming, game-making, and school.</p>
    <p>My proudest works include George 1 Remastered and The Lost Labyrinths, both on Scratch and IGM respectively. You can find those in the <b><a href="games">Games</a></b> page.</p>
    <p>Now, what do I like? Well, I like Minecraft. I play it way, <i>way</i> too much. I also really like the movies Holes, Coraline, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p>
    <p>Music? Well, my favorite artists are Tame Impala, Gorillaz, MGMT, Arctic Monkeys, Tally Hall, and Bill Wurtz.</p></div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>INFO ABOUT THIS SITE</h3>
    <p>This web site was created as a way for me to talk about <a href="blog">the stuff I talk to myself about</a> without having to make a Scratch project about it.</p>
    <p>The reason it doesn't look <i>nearly</i> as fancy as most modern websites is because I'm pretty ass at CSS, and still getting used to its quirks.</p>
    <p>Oh yea, this website used to be hosted on Neocities. However, the CSS took forever to upload, and the file size was limited (albeit I'd probably never reach the limit).</p>
    <p>Also GitHub is just better</p></div>

    <div class="quaternary"><h3>NOT-SO-FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
    <p>Q : What kind of games do you make? | A : Platformers, turn-based, and text-based games.</p>
    <p>Q : Why do you have over 35,000 hours on Cookie Clicker? | A : I like cookies.</p>
    <p>Q : Are you good at Fortnite? | A : Probably not.</p>
    <p>Q : Why does your web site suck complete ass? | A : Yours probably doesn't look much better.</p>
    <p>Q : What is your favorite show <i>ever</i>? | A : The Amazing World of Gumball.</p>
