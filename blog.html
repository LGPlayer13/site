      <p>well that wasn't very fun at all. <i>*cough*</i></p>
      <p>i got covid. yeah, remember that virus people kept talking about until some other crap happened and everyone forgot about? i got that <i>four years later</i>, and i'm still pretty shocked i got it at all. luckily for me, i have all my vaccines, boosters, and all that jazz, so i knew i wasn't about to perish or anything like that. still, the experience was less than stellar. it included such riveting symptoms as stomach pains (for a single night?), stuffy nose, immense fevers, loss of appetite, and lots of freaking gatorade. orange gatorade. there's still one on my desk...</p>
      <p>while i still have the virus within me, it's effects have almost entirely disappeared, and i'm hoping i can rid of it entirely by tomorrow because my godparents are throwing a neat party. the best part about this was that i got to skip 4 (not counting weekend) days of school. bet you weren't expecting <i>that</i>, weren't you? anyways, my spirits are slightly more up than usual and i'm more than ready to throw in the towel. high school has been a fairly miserable experience that i'm super excited to have to endure 3 more years of</p>
      <p>all i've been doing recently are listening to more depressing music and working a bit on FF and G1.5. for you Radiohead fans out there, i'm very sorry to tell you that <i>The King Of Limbs</i> is one of my favorite albums. not that i don't really like their more popular albums, i just really enjoy TKOL's unique, yet short-lived sound<br>in terms of more real life stuff, i'm getting into Wii Sports again. of all the fun games out there i could've gotten into, it just had to be Wii freaking Sports. at some point in time, i actually jailbroke my wii, but there was a slight issue. i used a <b>flash drive</b> instead of a <b>hard drive</b>, which is a big no-no when it comes to Wii modding. i had to suffer through many corruptions and crashes while modding the thing, not to mention the very frustrating internet connection issues. my Wii just <i>despises</i> the 5G wifi in our house and has found a new hobby of throwing error codes at my face</p>
      <p>the problem with playing Wii Sports tennis and baseball for hours straight as George the Triangle is that your arm gets sore. like, <i>really</i> sore. for an entire day. well, maybe your arm wouldn't start wishing for its own death in that situation, but mine sure did. man, i am running out of things to talk about here. goods bye to you alls</p>
