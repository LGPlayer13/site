    <div class="main"><h3>BLOG</h3>
    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>You should expect new posts every 3-6 days. <a style="color:#b57c1e;">Short</a> posts may come in-between.<br><b><a style="color:#8aab00;">Green</a></b> posts are about normal topics, <b><a style="color:#0005ab;">blue</a></b> posts are about emotional topics, <b><a style="color:#ab0000;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants.</p></div>
  
    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#caec3b;border:7px groove #e8ff85;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">uh huh</a> / <i>3/8/2024</i> / <i>10:27 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>the last few days have been quite the experience, i got basically nothing out of it</p>
    <p>remember that video i made on reindev where me and a friend played it while making fun of it? yeah, it led to some drama or whatever with its community. i'm not going to get into detail, as i'm sick of having to deal with their bullcrap reasons for hating on me and the video (and my website for some reason? idk, they ran out of stuff to whine about). overall, the mod itself is mostly fine, but i am never touching it again. for now, i'll stick with bta, and i might even try out not-so-seecret-saturday at some point</p>
    <p>anyhoo, my mood has improved throughout the week. i've completed my missing homework, i've started working on my projects again, and i'm just feeling a bit happier. yeah, school still sucks, but i've adapted to it and learned to just let it ride. we have a rally in a couple hours from now, and those are always a nice change of pace, if not a little tedious and uninteresting. i know i <i>should</i> have more school spirit, but it's kinda hard when i don't even like school to begin with</p>
    <p>one thing i'd like to mention is the new color-coded system for this blog. every blog post used to just be a boring gray, and i wanted to add some color to the website while also giving it a purpose. now, you'll be able to determine the mood of the post just through its color! so if you like my normal, everyday posts, you can just skip the blue and red ones and read the green ones! or if you like me venting my... issues... you can read the blue ones. just don't expect to laugh or smile much</p>
    <p>the red posts are interesting, as they're reserved for what i call "angry rants". i'm not sure if you'd call my latest response post an "angry rant", but i left it as red because that's basically how i felt while writing it, which makes sense. on another note, i'm gonna really start experimenting with images on this web site, since some pages look a little bland. one examples is the <a href="games">Games</a> page, which recently got a handful of images added to it to spice it up. enjoy</p></div>
