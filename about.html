    <p>This is where you can find the essential info about who I am, what I do, and why I do it.</p>
    <p>You can also find extra information about me and my interests in the <a href="about-extras">About Extras</a> page.</p></div>
    
    <div class="secondary" style="background-color:#ea9747;border:7px groove #ee8927;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #593a16;"><h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>Good morning. I'm LG, some male kid (actually, I'm 15, believe it or not). I like to make small games on Scratch and IGM, play dumb video games, and rant. This is my web site, where I vent about my struggles, talk about my games, and unravel the odd story of the <u>discs</u>.</p>
    <p>I'll be updating this web site <i>very</i> frequently, as I have a lot more to rant about and a lot more stories to tell. Hope you all enjoy what I have to offer, unless I'm not offering anything at the moment.</p>
    <p>If you're here to get in contact with me, you can do that via my Discord server, found below the Navbar. Otherwise, have fun on my digital home on the world wide web.</p></div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>ABOUT THIS SITE</h3>
    <p>This web site was made as a way for me to talk about <a href="blog">the stuff I talk to myself about</a> without having to use a platform like X (formerly known as Twitter). I also get to add all sorts of fun details everywhere.</p>
    <p>The reason it doesn't look <i>nearly</i> as fancy as most modern websites is because I'm pretty mid when it comes to HTML and CSS, and I'm actively still getting used to their quirks.</p>
    <p>Oh yea, this website used to be hosted on Neocities. However, the CSS took forever to upload (it still does...?), and the file size was limited (albeit I'd probably never reach the limit).</p>
    <p>Also GitHub is just better</p></div>

    <div class="quaternary"><h3>NOT-VERY-FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
