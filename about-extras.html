    <div class="main"><h3>ABOUT EXTRAS</h3>
    <p>This is extra info about me that a sane person would normally not give a crap about.</p>
    <p>Contained here is a list of my favorite games, movies, and a <i>lot</i> about my taste in music.<br>Who knows, maybe I'll put my personal Spotify playlist on here.</p></div>
    
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>EXTRA INFO ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>Now, what do I like? Well, I like Minecraft. I play it way, <i>way</i> too much. I also really like the movies Holes, Coraline, Elf, James and the Giant Peach, Home Alone 1 & 2, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p>
    <p>As for games in general, my favorites are Minecraft, Pizza Tower, Sound Shapes, Baldi's Basics, Undertale, OMORI, and Stardew Valley. These games are pretty cool and fun, even though I haven't played some of them in a while.</p>
    <p>Music? Well, my favorite artists are Tame Impala, MGMT, Beck, Bill Wurtz, Vampire Weekend, and Foster The People. I also like The Strokes, Gorillaz, bo en, GUM, Arctic Monkeys, and Tally Hall. If you'd like to recommend music for me to check out, feel free to in the Guestbook.</p>
    <p>Favorite books? What are you talking about? I don't read, unless you count Diary of a Wimpy Kid.</p>
    <p>Oh crap, there's still more room here. Well, how about every school grade ranked from best to worst? Here we go; 8th, Daycare, 2nd, 4th, 5th, Kindergarten, 6th, 9th, 1st, 7th, 3rd. Eighth grade was awesome, third grade sucked complete ass.</p>
    <p>Now, I'm sure you're wondering about those <u>discs</u> I mentioned earlier. I gathered the <u>discs</u> as a way to preserve this near-lost media and document what they convey. I'm still not entirely sure on the full story of most of these <u>discs</u>, but I'll try to explain them as best as I can.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the code for the pages for these <u>discs</u> got corrupted a little while ago, and I can't seem to find out how to properly fix it. I think they've been scattered around these "hidden" pages of the web site. Hell, I'm not even sure if every <u>disc</u> survived the corruption. See what you can do while I try to fix this.</p></div>
