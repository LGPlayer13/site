    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#caec3b;border:7px groove #e8ff85;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">the (tricky) trials update</a> / <i>4/26/2024</i> / <i>9:03 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
      <p>out of all the minecraft update names, this one is probably the worst</p>
      <p>good morning, i'm writing a blog post. anyways, today i felt unreasonably happy. i'm pretty sure i was happy because it's the end of the week and school is no more for two days. well, that last part is a bit of a lie because i'm participating in this "footprints" walk event. the way it works is you walk a couple laps around a big ol' track for some "christian service hours", which are one the worst and most annoying school-related things to exist, alongside homework</p>
      <p>while chilling on my usual bench at the previously-mentioned school, i check out mojang's <i>minecraft monthly</i> series's latest episode, which actually revealed the name for mc 1.21! the name chosen was "tricky trials", which i and many others agree is pretty mid. at least 1.20 followed the [feature] & [feature] naming scheme, but this one doesn't, making it feel off. i think the trial chambers and the new mobs are honestly really neat (even though i haven't played a single screenshot), but it's just the name that rubs me the wrong way</p>
      <p>fire forge development is going pretty well, i've close to wrapping up the <i>cooking</i> mechanic for the third quest. i must also give a shout-out to lexal for becoming an official-ish playtester for the game, pointing out inconsistencies and errors while providing very helpful feedback. the launch of the first alpha version will likely contain anywhere from 8-10 quests, but don't let that fool you. these quests are <i>quite</i> long, and introduce mechanics that probably each require a tutorial. it's safe to say those quests will keep you busy</p>
      <p>i might as well take some time to talk about some minor updates i have made/plan to make on this web site. one change you probably haven't noticed is the addition of the <a href="fire-forge">fire forge page</a> and an overhaul to the <a href="the-lost-labyrinths">lost labyrinths page</a>. the original page was very bland and empty, so i've added some icons and new links to it. as for any other future updates, i don't have anything else really planned. but i <i>am</i> open to featuring other websites in the <a href="about">about page</a>! feel free to suggest one via my discord server or the guestbook</p>
