    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>You should expect new posts every 3-6 days. <a style="color:#b57c1e;">Short</a> posts may come in-between.<br><b><a style="color:#8aab00;">Green</a></b> posts are about normal topics, <b><a style="color:#0005ab;">blue</a></b> posts are about emotional topics, <b><a style="color:#ab0000;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants.</p></div>
  
    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#caec3b;border:7px groove #e8ff85;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">finger back</a> / <i>3/13/2024</i> / <i>3:19 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>i gotta wrap my unfinished homework, why is everything i do have to be unfinished</p>
    <p>since the release of the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/980147831">LG Productions Presentation</a>, i've been much more motivated to work on my games, SSMB and George 1.5 in particular. i plan to release a small (canon) demo of George 1.5 before moving on to working on both for a while. i hope to finish George 1.5 first, since there hasn't been a proper George Series installment since George 1, which was over <i>three years ago</i> now. however, George 1.5 and 2 will be <i>drastically</i> different from the first.</p>
    <p>i had a lot of fun writing the dialogue for the homies in the presentation, and now i kinda wanna make short animations like i used to, except they'll be better and less cringe. but since i have multiple games still waiting in priority queue, this is just an idea for now, kinda like that cory spinoff prototype i made. as for my youtube channel, i have a sequel planned for one video, but nothing else beyond that for the time being</p>
    <p>now that this web site has been officially "released", i can... uhh... basically return to whatever i was doing before, but now with a marginally bigger audience watching my every move. how nice. my next plans for the website don't really exist yet, but i plan to experiment with some CSS stuff in the near future. i'll probably make a dedicated secret page for testing out new layouts and CSS stuff, that'd be pretty fun. but for now, enjoy the few secrets that are already lying about</p>
    <p>man, i've really been enjoying the <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a> blog posts, i have no idea why i limited myself to like, 3 sentences beforehand. there's also the <a style="color:#1eb584;">longer</a> and <a style="color:#a100ff;">misc</a> categories, but they've only been used once, each for different, special reasons. also i remember telling myself in the car; "alright, the next blog post titles i make are actually gonna relate to the topic at hand", but looks like that ended quickly. for context, "finger back" is the 8th track on one of my favorite albums of all time</p></div>
