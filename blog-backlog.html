    <div class="secondary"><h3>the new abnormal / <i>1/27/2024</i> / <i>4:56 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>good morning, everyone. also why does my school's news channel thing suck complete ass?<br>every week they introduce some new music or editing, it's the most inconsistent thing i've ever watched</p>
    <p>y'know i expressed interest in watching oppenheimer with my dad, and he seemed pretty cool with it. but then he told me there was a sex scene, and for some f*cking reason i <i>almost</i> said "oh that's nothing new"</p>
    <p>i've also been listening to more of The Strokes, and i think i can safely say i like them now<br>did you know i used to be a "writer"? maybe i can make that the next post's topic</p>
    <p>"i am currently doing something" - lex, who i'm currently in a call with for some reason</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>loss like a boss / <i>1/25/2024</i> / <i>9:00 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>hey look i got my first music CD! what album is it? it's my favorite MGMT album, Congratulations<br>also i cringed <i>real</i> hard tonight over the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peMns78EROI">worst rap battle ever</a>, an uncomfortably amazing watch</p>
    <p>also i tried out pikmin 3, is good. i've only played throught the first two days, though...<br>the first two games are also bangers, though the dungeons in pikmin 2 can be a little repetitive at times</p>
    <p>i've also started playing reindev again! having a pretty good time in a singleplayer world so far<br>the wendigos are kinda terrifying when you encounter them, especially for a guy with just iron armor</p>
    <p>i should probably work on george 1.5, but maybe i could eat blades of grass instead</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>getting up in the morning / <i>1/22/2024</i> / <i>5:05 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>damn it's been 3 days since my last post, this is just so sad. i gotta get back to it<br>yesterday i switched back to spotify because volume adjustment is nonexistent on amazon music</p>
    <p>i also feel compelled to make a <i>language pack</i> for bta, so i am. it's gonna be great, trust me<br>debating on whether i should play pikmin 3 or better than adventure, vote now on your phones</p>
    <p>maybe instead of playing more bta, i should try reindev again. not sure why i stopped all of a sudden<br>the last time i remember playing it was in school during november, right after a PSAT test thing</p>
    <p>or i can just play cookie clicker, but i'm out of that phase. thank god</p></div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>rental car / <i>1/19/2024</i> / <i>9:38 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>w0wie today we had a rally at school. it consisted of the usual pep squad, dance team, etc.<br>in case you're wondering, i basically have -1 school spirit. is that bad? i don't know.</p>
    <p>after getting home, i <i>so badly</i> wanted to make a minecraft mod for BTA. there were many problems<br>being overwhelmed by these problems, i decided to mod paper minecraft. i've hit a new low</p>
    <p>but i hit an even further low when the freaking paper minecraft engine confused me<br>you see, i wanted to add a new dimension. but uhh, i couldn't quite figure out how to make it work</p>
    <p>i just want to make the citrus dimension that gives everyone cavities, help needed</p></div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>sure of it now / <i>1/17/2024</i> / <i>5:46 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>today was boring. today was boring. that's called "repetition", and we learned it in english<br>yeah, today was one of those days where "nothing happens", kinda like that one gumball episode</p>
    <p>today i actually rediscovered an album my dad used to play in the car. it's called Contra, and it's great<br>really, i don't know why it took so long. i specifically rembering hearing it on the way to IKEA</p>
    <p>i would talk about the double smp and all the incredible lore that's going on, but i can't right now<br>you see, lex added a few mods. but for some damn reason, they <b>can't be used with performance mods</b>.</p>
    <p>this is one of the 27 reasons i'm gonna build a new computer for myself</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>and the award goes to / <i>1/15/2024</i> / <i>11:42 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>hello gang, today i played bta after a month of double smp gaming, t'was pretty fun chilling on melonbta<br>my period 7 class also had a <b>take home test</b> for a f*cking <b>college-level</b> class, which is still insane to me</p>
    <p>as a birthday gift, my family paid for a new monitor for me to <i>eventually</i> use when i build a new computer<br>when i was driving with my cousin to buy it, he played three songs i like, which never happens. anywhere.</p>
    <p>glad i spent martin luther king jr. day not reminiscing on martin luther king jr. like everyone else<br>seriously, "special" days like these are literally just "no work and furniture sale" days</p>
    <p>today i also learned that giving each blog post its own page is gonna suck in the long run</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>happy birdhday / <i>1/13/2024</i> / <i>12:00 AM PST</i></h3>
    <p>it's my birthday! what am i doing with it? going to a theme park<br>just praying my vertigo is merciful this time, it was <i>not</i> fun at disney</p>
    <p>to celebrate, the <b>LG's 15th birthday update</b> has released for the website!<br>if you haven't already, check out the <a href="updates">Updates</a> page</p>
    <p>there's also a new <a href="lore">Lore</a> page, which <i>does not</i> have any serious stuff yet<br>however, it does contain two bizzare stories already...</p>
    <p>it's also <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Speedy663/">Speedy663</a>'s birthday, too! be sure to wish him a happy birthday when you can.</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>yes! no, i'm not ready / <i>1/11/2024</i> / <i>6:06 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>hmm i should work on george 1.5, except i'm also working on fire forge, except i'm also working on sid's adventure, except i'm also working on ssmb, except i'm also playing too much f*cking minecraft</p>
    <p>i also have a pretty cool idea for what to do for my birthday (which is in two days!!)<br>sadly, it's not a game or a demo, it's something to do with this web site</p>
    <p>i also want to experiment with images, i think they could spice up this web site a bit, hopefully.<br>in other news, the double smp has nothing going on. talk about filler content.</p>
    <p>finishing my spanish test while listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ed6UeDp1ek&t=380s">riff part of let it happen</a> was glorious</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>the second part / <i>1/9/2024</i> / <i>10:35 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>hey gang. school's back up, and my schedule got a little switched up. getting used to that will be fun.<br>today was also spent revising The Demon II, which is the single greatest novel ever written.</p>
    <p>for some reason i'm being accused of theft, when i don't even know the damn location of the base it got stolen from. i keep getting asked over and over again, "hey did you commit steal?"</p>
    <p>oh well. on other note, today was also spent playing with <i>magic</i>. i hit lex several times.<br>also a marriage happened at my base and i wasn't even there to witness it. whar</p>
    <p>gotta keep george from leaving his toothpaste in the pillowcase!!</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>logic just doesn't apply nowadays / <i>1/6/2024</i> / <i>11:03 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>intro: had an awesome, perilous journey in the aether. it ended, abruptly. for no good reason.<br>today, my parents wanted me to finish my AP HUG flashcards. <i>they're due next week.</i></p>
    <p>so, not a single one done. why? i was studying for some finals i'd missed, <b>pretty important.</b><br>my dad came into the room at night and went all "disappointed" and "upset" on me.</p>
    <p>for what reason? never got one. only some "we want them done now" bullshit. they don't have a proper reason and they <i>know</i> it. sometimes, they just don't <b><i>think</i></b> for a f*cking second.</p>
    <p>outro: being forced to do shitty homework that isn't due for another 10 days. pissed off, thanks a lot.</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>being very devilish / <i>1/3/2024</i> / <i>6:01 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>today was spent crying with lex over his modpack crashing many times<br>nothing worked!! rubidium, embeddium, optifine, it all crashed his 150+ mod-filled modpack</p>
    <p>i also learned that alex's mobs is a horrifying mod with centipedes and cockroaches and more worms and mosquitos, get it away from me please</p>
    <p>oh yeah, super also joined us for a watch party of a knock-off dream smp video, which was extremely entertaining and forgettable at the same time</p>
    <p>delightfully devilish, seymour</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>willy wanker's toy shop / <i>1/2/2024</i> / <i>4:17 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>forget what i said yesterday, the new wonka was actually pretty great<br>loved all the references they made (to the 1971 film)</p>
    <p>also wow the oompa loompas are much, <i>much</i> smaller than usual, were they always that small?<br>also why does only one oompa loompa actually appear</p>
    <p>on another note, the double smp season 0 ended yesterday. it was pretty fun and scuffed<br>praying season 1 is less scuffed and has infinitely less crashes (yeah, <i>lex</i>!)</p>
    <p>also yes <a style="color:#ff0000;">spoiler warning</a> for Wonka (2023), and of course this warning is at the end >:D</p></div>
    
    <div class="secondary"><h3>when the time feels right / <i>1/1/2024</i> / <i>12:51 AM PST</i></h3>
    <p>woh! it's a new year! time to celebrate by listening to funny history man, bill wurtz</p>
    <p>honestly i gotta step up my game this year, 2023 was probably my laziest year. hopefully going insane in minecraft can help.<br>today (actually yesterday), i tried the aether mod for the first time. i liked the flying cows and phygs, those zephyrs can die in a ditch.</p>
    <p>sometimes i think of something to write, but forget it instantly. i hate it when that happens.</p>
    <p>wonder how the new wonka is gonna fit in with the already established lore... (it probably won't.)</p></div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>time to pretend / <i>12/31/2023</i> / <i>8:38 AM PST</i></h3>
    <p>morning everyone. today is new year's eve, which is pretty crazy. this year went by like, <i>really</i> fast.<br>currently my only new year's resolution is to stop procrastinating so much.</p>
    <p>man, i love all of these neocities web sites, they're so fun to explore and read.</p>
    <p>thinking about adding a funny Lore page to this, so that you all can read more George lore and find out whatever the TLL lore is.</p>
    <p>the worst part about these posts is that i don't know when the text reaches the bottom of this here box<br>love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>double bass / <i>12/30/2023</i> / <i>8:25 PM PST</i></h3>
    <p>today i decided to update this web site after looking at lex's website. it's called "inspiration" i think. anyways, this website will be much better and will have much more interesting things, because i am clearly superior.</p>
    <p></p>also, the titles of these posts often don't relate to whatever they're about at all, they're usually lyrics from songs, titles of songs, or random gibberish. why? <i>why not?</i></p>
    <p>the double smp is gonna end soon. you probably don't even know what that is, and i'm not gonna bother telling you.</p>
    <p>aaaaah i keep wanting to write more crap, but i don't wanna bother you with more text</p></div>
