    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>You can find the most recent pages at the bottom. Originally this had a message about me being too lazy to not provide the times these posts were uploaded.</p></div>
    
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>creative writing essay / <i>1/29/2024</i> / <i>9:33 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>writing this at school today. i'm gonna talk about how i used to write crappy stories.
    <p>the first series i made was called "The Mysterious Islands", and it was about me and 3 of my classmates getting stuck on an island, trying to solve some terribly-thrown-together mystery with cringe dialogue<br>this only had about 3 entries in the series, each being about 10 pages long. the first "book" was fine, but the second devolved into some minecraft story mode: season 2 plotline where you go under bedrock or some crap, and don't get me started on the third, which involved some really lame pirates</p>
    <p>the next series i made was called... "Terraria: The Written Series". please help me- anyways, this series was about some guy called John who gets sucked into the world of terraria and some more crap<br>this might actually be the worst thing i've ever written. it had 4 entries, including such groundbreaking moments like the chapter where they build a bathroom, or John going insane because of the angler npc</p>
    <p>the third series was called "School's Kool" or something like that, and it was about clothes becoming so expensive that everyone became naked, then came a standard "disease starts zombie apocalypse"<br>okay this series had decently long entries, and... less cringy dialogue. the first involved, y'know, the school. the second, however, involved the main characters going to some middle-eastern country to save it from the disease, and one of them even went to prison</p>
    <p>the last series i made was called "Shoot Guys", and it was actually not too bad. it was about a bunch of stick figures on an island and they were in a constant cycle of violence and hiding, war stuff<br>aight, <i>this</i> is where stuff gets good. this series was split into about 18 short comics, and it was actually a cohesive storyline! it made sense, wasn't too cringy, and was overall a pretty neat series. a season two was started, but didn't get very far, sadly.</p></div>
