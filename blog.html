      <p>i should be studying for an AP test rn, but i have better and much more fun things to do</p>
      <p>my dad is expecting a fully completed practice FRQ (free-response question) by the time he gets home, but there's only like a 40% chance it'll be done. anyways, i visited my grandparents an hour ago, and it was quite nice. i don't see them often, so hopefully i'll get to hang with them more this summer. since i'm mostly likely not taking summer school, i'll also be able to get much more progress done on my current projects, like Fire Forge and George 1.5</p>
      <p>now that i've finally discovered the joys of using <i>height:auto;</i> i can finally not have to worry about sizing issues. however, that kinda eliminates the whole "short/long/longer blog" thing, since now blogs can be as long as they want, even longer than those <a style="color:#1eb584;">longer</a> blog posts. i may also switch to <i>weekly</i> blog posts instead of 1 to 2 a week. i don't know, maybe i could release a post every saturday. a week should be plenty of time for me to come up with things to write about. it was especially hard when i still released posts every 2-3 days. welp, i've made up my mind; the "short/long/longer" labels are being abolished, in favor of writing however much i want<br>i could also give each blog post its own page thanks to my second discovery, <b>folders</b>. i might consider this in the future, but the Blog Backlog is staying for now</p>
      <p>i wonder how long it would feasibly take someone to read through my entire blog. yea, it's less than 5 months old, but i think there's enough material to keep someone reading for a decently long while. this just popped in my head; what if i gave each post its own <i>tag</i> specifying what it's about? well, there's multiple problems with that right off the bat. first off, these blogs aren't really about... anything. second, we already have the color-coded system for the mood of a blog. plus, the last time i used a color other than green was with The Post Who Shall Not Be Named</p>
      <p>my youtube hobby has become quite dormant ever since the Terraria 1.0.6.4 video, that's mainly because i've been obsessively working on this web site and my games, which doesn't make for great videos. instead, i'm gonna look into <b>streaming on Twitch</b> sometime. i already <i>have</i> an account, but i haven't exactly done much with it. my streams will consist of gaming, game-making, and maybe some other random stuff. i haven't bothered watching any tutorials or setting up a schedule at all, but i am still interested in doing so</p>
