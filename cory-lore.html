    <p>STORY : Part 1</p>
    <p>Cory was first harvested on the planet of Cubonin by his two loving parents. After waking up from being harvested, he was taken into his new home. Cory was treated well and performed well in school, life was good. However, when he turned six years old, his parents finally told him about his sister.</p>
    <p>The two Cuber parents originally had a little girl named Wendy. She loved to play around and explore the world, always getting lost in the woods and eventually finding her way back home. Later, she was kidnapped by an unknown individual and has thought to have passed away since.</p></div>
    <div class="secondary"><h3>Page 5 out of 7</i></h3>
    <p>STORY : Part 2</p>
    <p>After hearing this, Cory was very sad to have known he could've had a sister who would be there for him. But that didn't stop him from wanting a sister. Two years after he first heard the tragic story, Cory's parents came home from work one day with a bassinet. Inside it contained Sparky, a baby Trihbo.</p>
    <p>Cory was delighted to know that he'd have a new, adopted sister to be with him for the rest of his life.</p></div>
    <div class="secondary"><h3>Page 6 out of 7</i></h3>
    <p>STORY : Part 3</p>
    <p>When Cory turned nineteen years old, he was finally ready to leave home and adventure to another planet. He decided to take Sparky with him since he felt she needed an adventure, too. After an emotional goodbye, Cory and Sparky flew to Planet Swaqon, where they took in the breathtaking new landscapes and people. They toured all around the planet for a while, then the two eventually settled in a small house near a small town.</p>
    <p>Life was fairly normal for the two until 7 years later, when they were walking along a road eating some ice cream. They saw two flying triangles chasing each other in the sky, and decided to see what was going on. When they arrived at the Rocky Hillside, they saw one of the triangles lying facedown on the ground.</p></div>
    <div class="secondary"><h3>Page 7 out of 7</i></h3>
    <p>STORY : Part 4</p>
    <p>They helped George to their house and got introduced to him. Cory said that he'd help George find his brother, while Sparky stayed home and finished her college degree. Life would only be different from then...</p></div>
