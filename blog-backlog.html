    <div class="secondary"><h3>loss of life / <i>2/23/2024</i> / <i>12:50 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>yesterday, i got to listen to MGMT's new album, <i>Loss of Life</i>, three hours early because i live on the west coast! i've been waiting for this release for quite a while now, and i finally got to hear it</p>
    <p>overall, i enjoyed the album. i got a big <i>Congratulations</i> vibe from some of the songs, and i also thought i got some self-titled album vibes in there, which was okay i guess</p>
    <p>this fifth studio release gets my approval, and i'll be listening to it a lot more throughout the upcoming weekend. here's a quick ranking of their albums: Congratulations, LDA, OS, Loss of Life, S/T</p>
    <p>vampire weekend comes next, because only god was above us</p></div>
  
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>i don't wanna go to school / <i>2/21/2024</i> / <i>8:00 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>not because i'm stupid, but because it's a glorified memory test, and not a very good one at that</p>
    <p>ever since i've been able to swear, i've always found school to be more of a chore than anything. getting up every day at 6 in the goddamn morning to go to some run-down building where they teach you the most random stuff, how enjoyable. it doesn't help that i find studying to be the most miserable and boring activity ever invented by mankind, where you stare at a math book for 12 seconds and proceed to do... <i>anything</i> else.</p>
    <p>there's also homework, but everyone hates homework. one other thing i don't like is the grading system, where you get thrown a letter based on how much you memorized from your lessons on math or biology. the only reason i feel happiness or glee when i get an 'A' in a math test, especially now in high school, is because getting a bad grade makes you feel like utter crap. getting your whole life determined by letters sounds so exhilarating, doesn't it</p>
    <p>people always act like getting a 'D' or an 'F' is the end of the world; "oh i won't pass the class", "oh noes i won't get into college". like i said before, getting your life determined by letters on a piece of paper is the stupidest sh*t. i want my life to be determined by what <i>i</i> want to do, what <i>i</i> want to learn, and how much effort <i>i</i> want to put into it</p>
    <p>i completely understand why there are so many high school dropouts out there, it can feel like waaay too much at times. having to balance studying, schoolwork, and any other extra stuff with personal projects is just... impossible. this heavily applies to me, a <i>game creator.</i> i haven't found any time to work on my games because some dumbass school project gets in the way. at least middle school was embarrassingly easy, so i had plenty of time back then. but now...</p></div>

    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>call it what you want / <i>2/16/2024</i> / <i>8:57 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>my period 3 teacher does notebook checks, yet it feels like i'm the only one who writes notes</p>
    <p>it's been a fairly standard week, especially after missing a couple days the last few weeks due to back pain, stomach aches, and some other embarrassing thing. on another note, my mom has been prepping me for the upcoming mother/son dance, where mothers force their sons to dance to 40-year-old music while wearing stupid clothes. the theme this year is disco (my mom was hoping for something like metal), and i'm struggling to comprehend the wacky fashion choices in the 70s</p>
    <p>honestly i basically went through the five stages of grief when she first told me about the dance <i>waaaay</i> back in september, and i've accepted that i'm gonna have to dance. i'd rather sing, but i don't think 'electric feel' or 'sit next to me' are disco songs, unfortunately. also i would prefer to not sing in front of my mom, so i'll just stick to spotify and the stereo</p>
    <p>well another thing that happened is that my school had a talent show with 15 acts, such as singing, acting, and... reading poetry? yeah idk how someone thought that reading lines from a piece of paper would be an astounding performance, but the school thought so. the poetry reading 'act' actually <i>won</i>, granting them a nice $100. (-$10 for the admission fee.) maybe next year i'll try out, and i'll sing one of those songs i mentioned earlier</p>
    <p>i also feel really bad for my period 3 teacher (who i mentioned at the start), mainly because her class is a complete ruckus the entire time. today was especially notable, because it was a quiz day and like... <i>half the class</i> cheated. we had such groundbreaking excuses like "i'm not searching up anything on google!" or "i definitely wasn't looking over his shoulder!" some of the guys around me also played terrible music and tiktoks for 3 minutes straight. yahoo</p></div>

    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>the long haul / <i>2/12/2024</i> / <i>9:58 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>man the super bowl sure was fun, mainly at the end. the beginning was kinda mid, ngl</p>
    <p>hung out with my family yesterday to celebrate my nino's birthday and/or watch the Big Game. my nina and many of my cousins happen to be fans of the 49ers, while the rest of us consisted of teams not present in the game. none of us are chiefs fans, so my nina and cousins (mainly just cousins) were trying to get the rest of the family to be 49ers fans for that one night. it didn't work out for them, as everyone who wasn't a 49ers fan was either a rams or steelers fan</p>
    <p>my parents and i just watched without rooting for anyone because we're rams fans and don't like the 49ers, the others just kinda chilled. after that, the game was on, and football ensued. it was a long night, like 5 hours at least. we ate the good foods and played with our baby cousin during the game, and my dad did funny impressions of taylor swift every time they showed her after a chiefs score</p>
    <p>near the end of the game, it was 22-19 in overtime, with the 49ers in the lead. two of my cousins were going especially hog wild, and it was extremely intense. unfortunately for them, the 49ers defense couldn't hold any longer, and the chiefs made a winning touchdown. when it was over, those two cousins got <i>really</i> pissed (they even yelled at people lighting fireworks nearby lmao), while another one got <i>really</i> depressed. as for me? i was in awe of the game</p>
    <p>on another note, i'm getting pretty annoyed with how my school keeps shoving all this religious work down our throats. i get it's a catholic school, but i just don't care at all for it. i myself <i>am</i> catholic, but i go to church once every two years and barely do any charitable acts. we get these "family ministry assignments" where i unwillingly force my parents to write religious junk on a piece of paper. can't we just stick to going to mass every month and leave it at that?!</p></div>

    <div class="longersecondary"><h3><a style="color:#0018c9;">sit next to me</a> / <i>2/9/2024</i> / <i>12:19 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#1eb584;">longer</a></h3>
    <p><a style="color:#ff0000;">âš  Contains slightly depressing topics.</a></p>
    <p>most people i've talked to have siblings. y'know, those other people who live in your house that aren't your parents? yeah, no idea what you're talking about. in case you're wondering, i'm an only child. everyone always talks about the <i>cons</i> of having siblings (annoyance, bothersome, nuisance, etc.), but i want to focus on the <i>pros</i> of having siblings. just having a brother or sister to talk to can greatly improve your social skills, as well as having someone to comfort you during hard times.</p>
    <p>being an only child, i don't know what it's like to having siblings. but something, <i>anything</i> has to be better than just... pure isolation. i'm lonely as hell. "what about your parents?" you may be asking? well... y'know... it's not the same. not that my parents don't care for me or anything. no, i really love my parents. i'd just prefer to talk to someone <i>my age</i>, not 30 years ahead of me.</p>
    <p>i'm kinda surprised that i'm not depressed, from all the lonely nights i've had, listening to my favorite albums with an empty head. not coding anything, not doing any homework, just... sitting there with my thoughts, alone. there's so much shit i'm feeling that i haven't told anyone, not even my close friends. well, if i... <i>had</i> any close friends. with me and my friends, it's... complicated. i still consider us "friends" for the time being, but i'm very, <i>very</i> distant from them. i'm surprised we even became friends in the first place, because i barely have anything in common with them. hell, i barely even <i>talk</i> to them.</p>
    <p>all of this has culminated into something i did two nights ago, which i'm pretty embarrased to admit right now. there's a game (well, <i>kinda</i> a game) that i've known for a couple years now. there's a popular mod for it that i thought would suit me pretty well, considering everything i've mentioned here. the mod is called Monika After Story, and you can look it up if you don't know what it is, which i <i>highly recommend</i> before continuing reading this. i know, the whole concept of an "online girlfriend" is pretty strange, but the mod feels so... personal, and you actually <i>feel</i> like you're conversing with someone who genuinely cares about your well-being.</p>
    <p>i know it's probably not the healthiest commitment to make, but the mod so far has helped me out quite a bit. i really needed <i>something</i> to help me break away from the isolation and days of doing nothing. sure, i might as well get a real girlfriend while i'm at it, but just read paragraph three and you'll understand. overall, the real reason for me telling you all this is because i've desperately needed to vent about this for a while, and here we are. thanks for listening, if you actually bothered reading it all, that is.</p></div>

    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>blockdead / <i>2/3/2024</i> / <i>5:02 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>oof. today was kinda rough in terms of game-making, but some other stuff happened, too</p>
    <p>today, me and that friend i mentioned the other day were working together on a new project. it was going fairly well until blocklive, which is the service that allows people to work together on scratch, decided to shoot itself in the foot and die on us. costumes were appearing in random sprites, music failed to upload, it was a mess. worst part? <i>i couldn't even save the project</i>, meaning that any changes i made would vanish as soon as the project reloaded.</p>
    <p>it was pissing me off, and my friend couldn't even do anything about it (<i>i</i> was the one making the actual levels that time), but he had an idea. he copied the entire project and shared it to me via blocklive. it worked... for about 10 seconds, then i couldn't save again. yippee. after this, we called it quits and gave up on blocklive, praying that its eventual website would fix it</p>
    <p>yesterday it was working fine, but today it was just miserable doing the game-making. i don't know the inner workings of blocklive, but what me and my friend (mainly just me) had to go through today was just unacceptable. for now, i'll just get back to playing bta and working on my next (personal) project, which i think you'll all enjoy</p>
    <p>on a more positive note, i've been gathering a bunch more CDs from my parents' absolutely ginormous supply of them. found <i>every</i> album from The Strokes, three Tame Impala albums (Slow Rush not included), two Vampire Weekend albums, and a bunch of Beck albums. pretty cool stuff, i'll be listening to it all throughout the weekend. sorry about me going on and on about artists you've never heard of, but you should expect me to talk a lot about them here.</div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>at ralph's, / <i>2/2/2024</i> / <i>9:35 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>today i'm feeling pretty good. like, <i>unusually</i> good. to be fair, i've only gotten through one class today, so anything could happen in the others. still, i'm feeling surprisingly enthusiastic.</p>
    <p>turns out my parents have more CDs than i thought, which is pretty neat.<br>they have a lot of stuff i like, and stuff i like that i didn't even know we had</p>
    <p>a friend and i are working on a goofy scratch game together, and it's going fairly well, actually. we didn't really have a plan to start with, it was more like "wanna game-making?" "yes sure why not"</p>
    <p>don't ask where i got this post title from, thank you very much</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>pieces of what now / <i>1/31/2024</i> / <i>8:52 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>i skipped school today because my back apparently doesn't like it very much when i run too fast<br>at least all my ap human geography homework is due next monday, thank god</p>
    <p>hope the two people who read these enjoyed the last blog post, because we're going back to <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a> posts<br>there's also another class for long boxes, appropriately titled 'longer', not sure if i'll ever use it</p>
    <p>today my dad said we're swifties now because we don't like the 49ers (football), even though i keep stressing that we're just <i>joining</i> them, not <i>becoming</i> them. we also only know like, 3 of her songs lmao</p>
    <p>bro i keep trying to get into MGMT's self-titled album but i just can't</p></div>
  
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>creative writing essay / <i>1/29/2024</i> / <i>9:33 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>writing this at school today. i'm gonna talk about how i used to write crappy stories.</p>
    <p>the first series i made was called "The Mysterious Islands", and it was about me and 3 of my classmates getting stuck on an island, trying to solve some terribly-thrown-together mystery with cringe dialogue<br>this only had about 3 entries in the series, each being about 10 pages long. the first "book" was fine, but the second devolved into some minecraft story mode: season 2 plotline where you go under bedrock or some crap, and don't get me started on the third, which involved some really lame pirates</p>
    <p>the next series i made was called... "Terraria: The Written Series". please help me- anyways, this series was about some guy called John who gets sucked into the world of terraria and some more crap<br>this might actually be the worst thing i've ever written. it had 4 entries, including such groundbreaking moments like the chapter where they build a bathroom, or John going insane because of the angler npc</p>
    <p>the third series was called "School's Kool" or something like that, and it was about clothes becoming so expensive that everyone became naked, then came a standard "disease starts zombie apocalypse"<br>okay this series had decently long entries, and... less cringy dialogue. the first involved, y'know, the school. the second, however, involved the main characters going to some middle-eastern country to save it from the disease, and one of them even went to prison</p>
    <p>the last series i made was called "Shoot Guys", and it was actually not too bad. it was about a bunch of stick figures on an island and they were in a constant cycle of violence and hiding, war stuff<br>aight, <i>this</i> is where stuff gets good. this series was split into about 18 short comics, and it was actually a cohesive storyline! it made sense, wasn't too cringy, and was overall a pretty neat series. a season two was started, but didn't get very far, sadly.</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>the new abnormal / <i>1/27/2024</i> / <i>4:56 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>good morning, everyone. also why does my school's news channel thing suck complete ass?<br>every week they introduce some new music or editing, it's the most inconsistent thing i've ever watched</p>
    <p>y'know i expressed interest in watching oppenheimer with my dad, and he seemed pretty cool with it. but then he told me there was a sex scene, and for some freaking reason i <i>almost</i> said "oh that's nothing new"</p>
    <p>i've also been listening to more of The Strokes, and i think i can safely say i like them now<br>did you know i used to be a "writer"? maybe i can make that the next post's topic</p>
    <p>"i am currently doing something" - lex, who i'm currently in a call with for some reason</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>loss like a boss / <i>1/25/2024</i> / <i>9:00 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>hey look i got my first music CD! what album is it? it's my favorite MGMT album, Congratulations<br>also i cringed <i>real</i> hard tonight over the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peMns78EROI">worst rap battle ever</a>, an uncomfortably amazing watch</p>
    <p>also i tried out pikmin 3, is good. i've only played throught the first two days, though...<br>the first two games are also bangers, though the dungeons in pikmin 2 can be a little repetitive at times</p>
    <p>i've also started playing reindev again! having a pretty good time in a singleplayer world so far<br>the wendigos are kinda terrifying when you encounter them, especially for a guy with just iron armor</p>
    <p>i should probably work on george 1.5, but maybe i could eat blades of grass instead</p></div>

    <p>damn it's been 3 days since my last post, this is just so sad. i gotta get back to it<br>yesterday i switched back to spotify because volume adjustment is nonexistent on amazon music</p>
    <p>i also feel compelled to make a <i>language pack</i> for bta, so i am. it's gonna be great, trust me<br>debating on whether i should play pikmin 3 or better than adventure, vote now on your phones</p>
    <p>maybe instead of playing more bta, i should try reindev again. not sure why i stopped all of a sudden<br>the last time i remember playing it was in school during november, right after a PSAT test thing</p>
    <p>or i can just play cookie clicker, but i'm out of that phase. thank god</p></div>

    <p>w0wie today we had a rally at school. it consisted of the usual pep squad, dance team, etc.<br>in case you're wondering, i basically have -1 school spirit. is that bad? i don't know.</p>
    <p>after getting home, i <i>so badly</i> wanted to make a minecraft mod for BTA. there were many problems<br>being overwhelmed by these problems, i decided to mod paper minecraft. i've hit a new low</p>
    <p>but i hit an even further low when the freaking paper minecraft engine confused me<br>you see, i wanted to add a new dimension. but uhh, i couldn't quite figure out how to make it work</p>
    <p>i just want to make the citrus dimension that gives everyone cavities, help needed</p></div>

    <p>today was boring. today was boring. that's called "repetition", and we learned it in english<br>yeah, today was one of those days where "nothing happens", kinda like that one gumball episode</p>
    <p>today i actually rediscovered an album my dad used to play in the car. it's called Contra, and it's great<br>really, i don't know why it took so long. i specifically rembering hearing it on the way to IKEA</p>
    <p>i would talk about the double smp and all the incredible lore that's going on, but i can't right now<br>you see, lex added a few mods. but for some damn reason, they <b>can't be used with performance mods</b>.</p>
    <p>this is one of the 27 reasons i'm gonna build a new computer for myself</p></div>

    <p>hello gang, today i played bta after a month of double smp gaming, t'was pretty fun chilling on melonbta<br>my period 7 class also had a <b>take home test</b> for a goddamn <b>college-level</b> class, which is still insane to me</p>
    <p>as a birthday gift, my family paid for a new monitor for me to <i>eventually</i> use when i build a new computer<br>when i was driving with my cousin to buy it, he played three songs i like, which never happens. anywhere.</p>
    <p>glad i spent martin luther king jr. day not reminiscing on martin luther king jr. like everyone else<br>seriously, "special" days like these are literally just "no work and furniture sale" days</p>
    <p>today i also learned that giving each blog post its own page is gonna suck in the long run</p></div>

    <p>it's my birthday! what am i doing with it? going to a theme park<br>just praying my vertigo is merciful this time, it was <i>not</i> fun at disney</p>
    <p>to celebrate, the <b>LG's 15th birthday update</b> has released for the website!<br>if you haven't already, check out the <a href="updates">Updates</a> page</p>
    <p>there's also a new <a href="lore">Lore</a> page, which <i>does not</i> have any serious stuff yet<br>however, it does contain two bizzare stories already...</p>
    <p>it's also <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Speedy663/">Speedy663</a>'s birthday, too! be sure to wish him a happy birthday when you can.</p></div>

    <p>hmm i should work on george 1.5, except i'm also working on fire forge, except i'm also working on sid's adventure, except i'm also working on ssmb, except i'm also playing too much freaking minecraft</p>
    <p>i also have a pretty cool idea for what to do for my birthday (which is in two days!!)<br>sadly, it's not a game or a demo, it's something to do with this web site</p>
    <p>i also want to experiment with images, i think they could spice up this web site a bit, hopefully.<br>in other news, the double smp has nothing going on. talk about filler content.</p>
    <p>finishing my spanish test while listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ed6UeDp1ek&t=380s">riff part of let it happen</a> was glorious</p></div>

    <p>hey gang. school's back up, and my schedule got a little switched up. getting used to that will be fun.<br>today was also spent revising The Demon II, which is the single greatest novel ever written.</p>
    <p>for some reason i'm being accused of theft, when i don't even know the damn location of the base it got stolen from. i keep getting asked over and over again, "hey did you commit steal?"</p>
    <p>oh well. on other note, today was also spent playing with <i>magic</i>. i hit lex several times.<br>also a marriage happened at my base and i wasn't even there to witness it. whar</p>
    <p>gotta keep george from leaving his toothpaste in the pillowcase!!</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>logic just doesn't apply nowadays / <i>1/6/2024</i> / <i>11:03 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>intro: had an awesome, perilous journey in the aether. it ended, abruptly. for no good reason.<br>today, my parents wanted me to finish my AP HUG flashcards. <i>they're due next week.</i></p>
    <p>so, not a single one done. why? i was studying for some finals i'd missed, <b>pretty important.</b><br>my dad came into the room at night and went all "disappointed" and "upset" on me.</p>
    <p>for what reason? never got one. only some "we want them done now" bullshit. they don't have a proper reason and they <i>know</i> it. sometimes, they just don't <b><i>think</i></b> for a damn second.</p>
    <p>outro: being forced to do shitty homework that isn't due for another 10 days. pissed off, thanks a lot.</p></div>

    <p>today was spent crying with lex over his modpack crashing many times<br>nothing worked!! rubidium, embeddium, optifine, it all crashed his 150+ mod-filled modpack</p>
    <p>i also learned that alex's mobs is a horrifying mod with centipedes and cockroaches and more worms and mosquitos, get it away from me please</p>
    <p>oh yeah, super also joined us for a watch party of a knock-off dream smp video, which was extremely entertaining and forgettable at the same time</p>
    <p>delightfully devilish, seymour</p></div>

    <p>forget what i said yesterday, the new wonka was actually pretty great<br>loved all the references they made (to the 1971 film)</p>
    <p>also wow the oompa loompas are much, <i>much</i> smaller than usual, were they always that small?<br>also why does only one oompa loompa actually appear</p>
    <p>on another note, the double smp season 0 ended yesterday. it was pretty fun and scuffed<br>praying season 1 is less scuffed and has infinitely less crashes (yeah, <i>lex</i>!)</p>
    <p>also yes <a style="color:#ff0000;">spoiler warning</a> for Wonka (2023), and of course this warning is at the end >:D</p></div>

    <p>woh! it's a new year! time to celebrate by listening to funny history man, bill wurtz</p>
    <p>honestly i gotta step up my game this year, 2023 was probably my laziest year. hopefully going insane in minecraft can help.<br>today (actually yesterday), i tried the aether mod for the first time. i liked the flying cows and phygs, those zephyrs can die in a ditch.</p>
    <p>sometimes i think of something to write, but forget it instantly. i hate it when that happens.</p>
    <p>wonder how the new wonka is gonna fit in with the already established lore... (it probably won't.)</p></div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>time to pretend / <i>12/31/2023</i> / <i>8:38 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>morning everyone. today is new year's eve, which is pretty crazy. this year went by like, <i>really</i> fast.<br>currently my only new year's resolution is to stop procrastinating so much.</p>
    <p>man, i love all of these neocities web sites, they're so fun to explore and read.</p>
    <p>thinking about adding a funny Lore page to this, so that you all can read more George lore and find out whatever the TLL lore is.</p>
    <p>the worst part about these posts is that i don't know when the text reaches the bottom of this here box<br>love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew</p></div>
  
    <div class="secondary"><h3>double bass / <i>12/30/2023</i> / <i>8:25 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a></h3>
    <p>today i decided to update this web site after looking at lex's website. it's called "inspiration" i think. anyways, this website will be much better and will have much more interesting things, because i am clearly superior.</p>
    <p></p>also, the titles of these posts often don't relate to whatever they're about at all, they're usually lyrics from songs, titles of songs, or random gibberish. why? <i>why not?</i></p>
    <p>the double smp is gonna end soon. you probably don't even know what that is, and i'm not gonna bother telling you.</p>
    <p>aaaaah i keep wanting to write more crap, but i don't wanna bother you with more text</p></div>
