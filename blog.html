    <div class="main"><h3>BLOG</h3>
    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>The most recent blog post is shown right below, and the rest can be found in the Blog Backlog.<br>Expect new posts every 3-6 days. <a style="color:#b57c1e;">Short</a> posts may come in-between.</p></div>
    
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>call it what you want / <i>2/16/2024</i> / <i>8:57 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>my period 3 teacher does notebook checks, yet it feels like i'm the only one who writes notes</p>
    <p>it's been a fairly standard week, especially after missing a couple days the last few weeks due to back pain, stomach aches, and some other embarrassing thing. on another note, my mom has been prepping me for the upcoming mother/son dance, where mothers force their sons to dance to 40-year-old music while wearing stupid clothes. the theme this year is disco (my mom was hoping for something like metal), and i'm struggling to comprehend the wacky fashion choices in the 70s</p>
    <p>honestly i basically went through the five stages of grief when she first told me about the dance <i>waaaay</i> back in september, and i've accepted that i'm gonna have to dance. i'd rather sing, but i don't think 'electric feel' or 'sit next to me' are disco songs, unfortunately. also i would prefer to not sing in front of my mom, so i'll just stick to spotify and the stereo</p>
    <p>well another thing that happened is that my school had a talent show with 15 acts, such as singing, acting, and... reading poetry? yeah idk how someone thought that reading lines from a piece of paper would be an astounding performance, but the school thought so. the poetry reading 'act' actually <i>won</i>, granting them a nice $100. (-$10 for the admission fee.) maybe next year i'll try out, and i'll sing one of those songs i mentioned earlier</p>
    <p>i also feel really bad for my period 3 teacher (who i mentioned at the start), mainly because her class is a complete ruckus the entire time. today was especially notable, because it was a quiz day and like... <i>half the class</i> cheated. we had such groundbreaking excuses like "i'm not searching up anything on google!" or "i definitely wasn't looking over his shoulder!" some of the guys around me also played terrible music and tiktoks for 3 minutes straight. yahoo</p></div>
