      <p>the last one out of the box, the last one who broke the spell</p>
      <p>this is the first blog post of mine to be split into different <i>parts</i>, since the title is both a song reference and three blog posts in one, how neat! <b>the horrible server</b> is referring to the Cambrian and Logdam SMPs, which i happen to have a bit of history with. <b>testday</b> refers to an AP exam i took, as i have quite a few thoughts on it. <b>barebones</b> is referring to project development as a whole, and how not-very-swell it's been going recently</p>
      <p>--------------------------------</p>
      <p><u>May 7th</u> : back in the wonderous year of 2022, a user called <i>Super</i> on the Dashnet Forums created a neat IGM game. it had great pixel art was fairly unique, so me and a couple others became invested in the game's development. soon enough, Super created an entire discord server for the game, and it was called <i>Cambrian</i>. after some more devlopment shenanigans occurred, a <i>Minecraft SMP</i> came to fruition out of the blue. despite this, everyone was supportive, and the smp was started.</p>
      <p>it was all fun and games until the third day came. Super had invited a particular individual to the server who he'd had a lengthy history with, and not a good one. the <b>rabbit</b> was known for tryharding on every server he was on, demanding control over everyone for his overdramatic youtube videos. well this was no different; he and his friends (who had infiltrated the server on hidden accounts) got OP gear and witherbombed the entire server. there <i>was</i> a short 2-minute video made by the guy himself, but it was lost after he switched accounts.</p>
      <p>Super decided to start a second season of the smp, even though everyone was still on edge from that last one. anyways, this season was relatively successful for the short time it was up, and i actually teamed up with a couple people this time, instead of travelling 2,000 blocks away and being isolated. for <i>some f***ing reason</i>, Super decided to invite the <b>rabbit</b> to the server AGAIN. after they grinded for OP gear again, our base coords got leaked and it was soon invaded. the <b>rabbit</b> and his cohorts intimidated us at the base for a while before it all came crashing down in a withery inferno.</p>
      <p>after this, it was over and done. Super abandoned his projects and the SMP, and the majority of people ended up leaving Cambrian for good. however, i decided to stick around with the <b>rabbit</b>, as i was intrigued by where this whole smp thing would go next. now entering: the <i>Logdam SMP</i>. this smp had gone through tons of seasons and events previously, and apparently now was a great time for a new installment.</p>
      <p>once the launch event was finished and everyone was starting off, i teamed up with some really cool people (not the <b>rabbit</b> btw) and we had a nice village set up, even with its own McDonalds, made by yours truly. however, the <b>rabbit</b>, being himself, found our base coords by cheating or something and payed a nice visit to our village. after some back-and-forth'ing and a lot of intimidation, me and one of my basemates were just sick of this guy's sh*t, so we quit.</p>
      <p>...and that is where my affiliation with those SMPs concluded. the final Logdam SMP season actually has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEGUxhY9hrY">mid video</a> highlighting some of the events mentioned here. go watch it, even though it's bad and overdramatic. also can i just mention that the guy sounds <i>exactly</i> like wilbur soot</p>
      <p>--------------------------------</p>
      <p><u>May 8th</u> : yesterday i took an AP test, which is a <i>long</i> exam that jumbles everything you learned for the past 9 months and makes you recite very specific parts of it. in case you didn't know, AP tests are graded on a 1-5 scale, with 3 being the minimum to have "passed" the exam. i know i said i have "quite a few thoughs on it", but it really won't be that long.</p>
      <p>everyone was extremely nervous for the test in the morning, and i'm not sure if those donuts and chocolate milk helped. the room we took the test in was surprisingly nice, probably because they had the windows open. the exam itself took around 3 hours, being split into 2 distinct parts that test your <s>knowledge</s> ability to memorize junk well. i don't think i did absolutely amazing on the test, but literally everyone has the mindset of "oh boy i hope i at least get a 3".</p>
      <p>i guess it was a nice change of pace from the monotonous schedule we always go through, and we even got to go home early, if we wanted to that is. if you think i stayed then you are absolutely wrong and should consult a doctor. welp, guess there's nothing left to do except wait until july for the results. yes, it takes <i>that long</i> to get the results. i guess i don't blame them, going through hundreds of hand-written essays must be quite a chore.</p>
      <p>there's this one kid in my class with a condition or something that makes him cough a lot, and it didn't help that he felt congested that day. i'm really glad that i wasn't forced to sit next to him, since your seat in the AP test room is chosen randomly. i pray for the poor soul who had to sit next to that guy.</p>
      <p>--------------------------------</p>
      <p><u>May 9th</u> : game development has been quite slow as of recent. my "depressed" state has come back to haunt me, and i haven't been motivated to do much. sure, this web site has been blossoming quite nicely, but i need to focus on my games. y'know, the stuff i'm <i>known</i> for? after i made lots of progress on Fire Forge last month, i've kinda dropped the ball.</p>
      <p>as for George 1.5, i just haven't bothered working on it much at all. the stuff i <i>have</i> worked on is... not exactly good for overall progression. i already have an idea for the <i>credits</i> scene, which isn't exactly a good thing when not even the second freaking level is done. to help myself through this, i'm gonna start writing down the story on some document so i at least have something to refer to when writing the story.</p>
      <p>starting yesterday, my vertigo decided to pay me a little visit and cause me to have a little panic attack of sorts. if you haven't heard, vertigo is basically dizziness and motion sickness combined, resulting in a truly awful living experience. today i went to the doctor's office and finally got some closure on what the hell is wrong with me, as my previous doctors have done jacksh*t. he said it might be something to do with migraines, so that's pretty swag.</p>
      <p>hoping to get this all resolved by the end of summer. i'd really like for Fire Forge and George 1.5 to released by the end of this year, since i know that high school is gonna keep getting worse and harder on my sanity. sorry if this portion of the blog post isn't exactly as "<a style="color:#bdec47;text-shadow:1px 1px 3px #000000;">green</a>" as the others, but i need to get this off my chest.</p>
