      <p>just checked my two summer assignments today, they are quite the doozy</p>
      <p>well, it's been a while. longer than usual. luckily for me and all of you, it's summer break now, and i've already done quite a lot of stuff. the first thing i've decided to do is change the schedule for blog posts. they currently just kinda come out at random, usually taking 5-7 days each. however, i'm now starting a <b>weekly</b> blog post schedule, with a new post being written every monday. originally it was going to be every sunday, but i forgot to write one yesterday. also, the time each blog post comes out will continue to be random. i get 11 pm is slightly pushing it, but it still counts</p>
      <p>five days ago, i went to my first <i>real</i> concert. the reason i put <i>real</i> in there is because i previously went to a... ugh... a kidz bop concert many years ago, but i'm not counting that since all they do is covers. this time i went with my dad and his friend to see vampire weekend at the hollywood bowl. in just four short months i've already become a <i>big</i> fan of the group, and i even bought a shirt before the show started. the two opening groups were voodoo glow skulls (who weren't exactly my cup of tea) and the english beat (who were pretty cool, but their performance was surprisingly short)<br>anyways, ezra and the guys started at around 8 pm, and it was literally <i>just them</i> playing the first three songs, which was actually pretty neat. then they played ice cream piano, and the giant sheet behind them fell, revealing the rest of the live band. i honestly cried at that moment, probably because the whole experience and music were absolutely phenomenal. some surprise plays were the surfer, sympathy, and ladies of cambridge. there were even ska-ified versions of ottoman and giving up the gun that were played, which was neat. overall, their perfomance was a perfect 10/10</p>
      <p>two days ago, my family had a father's day barbeque at my house. it was entirely my grandpa's idea, even though the rest of us thought it would be <i>waaaay</i> easier to just go to a restaurant or something. despite this, we still went through with my grandpa's plan. unfortunately, the grill my nino has was found to be too difficult to bring to my backyard (even though we live <b>right next to each other</b>). so it was more like us just having lunch together. the day was mostly fine, but my baby cousin has recently taken a liking to a graduation picture of mine, and he's <i>always</i> repeating my name out loud, which, of course, the family adores.<br>now i don't know if you know this, but "moody teenager" and "baby" do <i>not</i> match. it was deeply frustrating and annoying hearing the kid just say my name over and over, with the family expecting me to react every time. sheesh. my dad was also like, "stop acting like a jerk, we're trying to teach him". okay, teach him <i>what</i> exactly? to repeat his uncle's name over and over? also, i wasn't scowling at the kid or anything, i was literally just sitting there. is sitting down and not paying attention 24/7 suddenly a <i>bad thing</i>? so yeah, fun day</p>
      <p>remember the double smp (or as it was officially called, the smp smp)? no? well, now there's a sequel- the stupid smp, or as i like to call it, the "lack of good sense or judgment smp". one mod in particular has intrigued me quite a bit, that mod being pneumaticcraft. it's a tech mod where you utilize compressed air, heat, and funny liquids to make cool contraptions and machines. it's the first tech mod i've learned a "decent" amount of while having fun doing it. anyways, expect a video on the stupid smp from me at some point. i know i said i'd make a chirpy reverie video beforehand, but i haven't bothered editing it yet, sorry 'bout that</p>
