      <p>being cramped on a bench with other kids you barely know is <i>just</i> the most fun ever</p>
      <p>writing this at school today. usually in my health class we'd sit on the lunch tables outside, where we have personal space and quiet. however, the teacher didn't take his don't-be-a-jackass pills today, so he just dumped us in the gym. now i'm sitting next to the students i'd want to sit next to the <i>least</i>. if you're wondering why i'd rather sit next to literally <i>anyone else</i>, all these particular students do is watch brainrot and cause me immense uncomfortableness. so yeah, my day is going well</p>
      <p>this week has been rather uneventful in terms of game development, but i've got a couple new ideas for videos i could make. i mainly want to make a <b>chirpy reverie</b> video and an <b>animal well</b> video. i haven't bought animal well yet, but it looks fun and it could make for an interesting blind playthrough. as for when i'll act on these ideas, i'm hoping to record something within the next few days. i haven't played chirpy reverie in quite a while, but i'm pretty excited to revisit it soon</p>
      <p>for some reason, i've been thinking a lot about what a future album of mine would look like. no, this does <i>not</i> mean i'll be attempting to enter the music industry anytime soon, but i think making an album (or at least an EP) would be pretty cool. if i ever did make one, i'd probably call it something like "The Isolated Hours" or something like that. oh yeah, if you can connect the dots on what the title relates to, you win a gold star. in the meantime, however, i'll stick to what's important- George 1.5.</p>
      <p>speaking of George, i recently updated the <i>geography</i> of Asfard <s>Island</s> Archipelago, the place the series takes place on. i'll probably make a Scratch project talking about it at some point, but that might take a bit. what i've made so far is just a <i>rough draft</i>, and it's not even in color. the reason for updating the island (now archipelago) in the first place is because i was running out of space to put more levels on the island. i didn't want to have to move this game to another island entirely, so i decided to transform Asfard into a new place entirely, even with some new toponyms! more updates soon. cya</p>
