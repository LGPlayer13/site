    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>The most recent blog post is shown right below, and the rest can be found in the Blog Backlog.</p></div>
    
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>the long haul / <i>2/12/2024</i> / <i>9:45 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#1eb584;">longer</a></h3>
    <p>man the super bowl sure was fun, mainly at the end. the beginning was kinda mid</p>
    <p>hung out with my family yesterday to celebrate my nino's birthday and/or watch the Big Game. my nina and many of my cousins happen to be fans of the 49ers, while the rest of us consisted of teams not present in the game. none of us are chiefs fans, so my nina and cousins (mainly just cousins) were trying to get the rest of the family to be 49ers fans for that one night</p>
    <p>my parents and i just watched without rooting for anyone because we're rams fans and don't like the 49ers, the others just kinda chilled. after that, the game was on, and football ensued. it was a long night, like 5 hours at least. we ate the good foods and played with our baby cousin during the game, and my dad did funny impressions of taylor swift every time they showed her after a chiefs score</p>
    <p>near the end of the game, it was 22-19 in overtime, with the 49ers in the lead. two of my cousins were going especially hogwild, and it was extremely intense. unfortunately for them, their defense couldn't hold any longer, and the chiefs made a winning touchdown. when it was over, those two cousins got <i>really</i> pissed, while another one got <i>really</i> depressed. as for me? i was in awe of the game.</p>
    <p>on another note, i'm getting pretty annoyed with how my school keeps shoving all this religious junk down our throats. i get it's a catholic school, but i just don't care at all for it. i myself <i>am</i> catholic, but i go to church once every two years and barely do any charitable acts. we get these "family ministry assignments" where i unwillingly force my parents to write stuff on a piece of paper. how fun.</p></div>
