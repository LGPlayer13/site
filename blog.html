    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>You should expect new posts every 3-6 days. <a style="color:#b57c1e;">Short</a> posts may come in-between.<br><b><a style="color:#8aab00;">Green</a></b> posts are about normal topics, <b><a style="color:#0005ab;">blue</a></b> posts are about emotional topics, <b><a style="color:#ab0000;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants.</p></div>
  
    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#b7d536;border:7px groove #d3e876;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">exporting and slightly reforming</a> / <i>3/18/2024</i> / <i>10:46 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>it's so much fun not taking notes in biology, how do i have an A in this class lmao</p>
    <p>man i am <i>struggling</i> to find good video editing software, let's run through the ones i've used so far. the built-in youtube editor: fine for the most part, if not a bit barebones. you can't upload .mp3 or .wav files to use in your video, which sucks. the second editor i used sorry i forgot: pretty mid UI design, at least you can upload music. exporting was a pain in the ass, and it looked bad too. (microsoft) clipchamp: the company behind this already shows it's mid</p>
    <p>i wanna make a video where i play rhythm tengoku or something, but i wanna settle on a good editor before recording. i've also never played rhythm heaven silver before and i'm interested in trying it out. while i've seen videos of it and heard of its apparent difficulty, i've played all of the other RH games and beaten them not-quite-100%. a video on bta <i>could</i> be more fun, but i wanna wait until the private server isn't dead before attempting that</p>
    <p>recently, after finishing an album and then letting spotify play whatever, a song called "15 Step" played, and i somehow instantly recognized the song. i checked and it was by radiohead, a band i knew my parents liked <i>a lot</i>. another song of theirs came on ("Airbag"), this time from a different album of theirs, which i also recognized. turns out i've heard both of those albums for over 10 years now. in my dad's car, that is. sorry for talking about music again, but at least this time it's new</p>
    <p>i've been having fun composing new songs in deflemask, it's fun to make chiptune music with the NES's extremely limited sound chip. i think my recent songs are much better than my first (no surprises there), and they're also much longer, too, which i consider a plus. maybe i'll consider making a full-length album some time, but it might be a while before that happens. i really like the idea of just... releasing an album. a bunch of your music in a neat little package, ready for anyone in the world to hear. until then, i'll consider releasing a couple singles i've made</p></div>
