    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>The most recent blog post is shown right below, and the rest can be found in the Blog Backlog.<br>Expect new posts every 3-6 days. <a style="color:#b57c1e;">Short</a> posts may come in-between.</p></div>
    
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>i don't wanna go to school / <i>2/21/2024</i> / <i>8:00 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>not because i'm stupid, but because it's a glorified memory test, and not a very good one at that</p>
    <p>ever since i've been able to swear, i've always found school to be more of a chore than anything. getting up every day at 6 in the goddamn morning to go to some run-down building where they teach you the most random stuff, how enjoyable. it doesn't help that i find studying to be the most miserable and boring activity ever invented by mankind, where you stare at a math book for 12 seconds and proceed to do... <i>anything</i> else.</p>
    <p>there's also homework, but everyone hates homework. one other thing i don't like is the grading system, where you get thrown a letter based on how much you memorized from your lessons on math or biology. the only reason i feel happiness or glee when i get an 'A' in a math test, especially now in high school, is because getting a bad grade makes you feel like utter crap. getting your whole life determined by letters sounds so exhilarating, doesn't it</p>
    <p>people always act like getting a 'D' or an 'F' is the end of the world; "oh i won't pass the class", "oh noes i won't get into college". like i said before, getting your life determined by letters on a piece of paper is the stupidest sh*t. i want my life to be determined by what <i>i</i> want to do, what <i>i</i> want to learn, and how much effort <i>i</i> want to put into it</p>
    <p>i completely understand why there are so many high school dropouts out there, it can feel like waaay too much at times. having to balance studying, schoolwork, and any other extra stuff with personal projects is just... impossible. this heavily applies to me, a <i>game creator.</i> i haven't found any time to work on my games because some dumbass school project gets in the way. at least middle school was embarrasingly easy, so i had plenty of time back then. but now...</p></div>
