    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#b7d536;border:7px groove #d3e876;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">quadruple primary</a> / <i>4/19/2024</i> / <i>3:37 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
      <p>i'm so glad my high school (they're very high indeed) has given us soundcloud rapper #81729361</p>
      <p>today my school had its last rally, and they wanted to go out with a bang, even though they actually ended up going out with a pop. this was a "student class competition", where each class had pre-determined students go up and compete for the title of [insert title here]. like usual, the seniors ended up winning, and the best part about my day was leaving. however, there was one <i>crucial</i> moment in the rally where a particular student went down to the middle of the gym and performed. it wasn't great, i'll say that right off the bat</p>
      <p>for some context, a "new and upcoming rapper" had recently gotten a name for himself in my school, even being featured in one of its weekly news video things. well this guy is apparently more popular than i thought, because he was invited to perform one of his songs from his album during the rally. after the sounds of the many screams destroyed my eardrums, the guy waddled his way down and started rapping along to his song. in case i haven't mentioned it before, i just plain don't like rap, and this guy wasn't exactly changing my mind</p>
      <p>straying away from that topic, i've started up development of <b>Fire Forge</b> again! this will be my next igm game after The Lost Labyrinths, and it's gonna be quite different. this game is a text-based, story-driven, tech-based game. not many igm games feature stories, and those that <i>have</i> stories don't exactly have... well, <i>proper</i> stories. the premise of FF will be You, the main character, asking your Friend to come over and help you burn stuff to make more complex stuff</p>
      <p>the gameplay will be... lots of clicking, like usual. but as you progress through the story and complete more quests, more mechanics and features will be introduced over time to keep the fire going. (get it?) i'm hoping to have the first alpha released in may or june, with the first 8-10 quests, along with some side stuff. there'll also be <i>over 300</i> unique topics that You and your Friend can discuss for the Friendship system, which will be discussed later. for now, expect some new teasers to be posted on my discord server
