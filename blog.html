    <div class="main"><h3>BLOG</h3>
    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>The most recent blog post is shown right below, and the rest can be found in the Blog Backlog.<br>Expect new posts every 3-6 days. <a style="color:#b57c1e;">Short</a> posts may come in-between.</p></div>
  
    <div class="longsecondary"><h3>i actually don't like reindev that much / <i>2/26/2024</i> / <i>10:30 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>this is my first video in like, 5 months. wonder how it'll turn out</p>
    <p>when i started my youtube channel back in 2022, it was more of a hobby than anything. two years later, and it still is, bit with a bit more heart put into it. i've been told "you should start streaming" multiple times, but i'm just gonna stick to videos for right now. anyways, the raw footage for my next video finished uploading last night, it's almost <i>two hours long</i>. this is gonna be quite fun to edit when i get back from school</p>
    <p>i don't use any "proper" editing software, i just use youtube's built-in editor to trim the footage a bit, but i wanna be a bit more rambunctious this time. what i mean by that is editing in music, transitions, even more jump-cuts, stuff like that, because a nearly two-hour-long video of two idiots building a house in a dead reindev server doesn't sound that exciting on paper</p>
    <p>i might as well give my thoughts on reindev while we're here. the mod is just ok; it runs fine, it looks like sh*t, and it has a more quantity-over-quality approach with all of the janky stuff it adds. the stuff i <i>do</i> like is the ambience and the<br>the stuff i <i>don't</i> like includes the "overhauled" nether, potions, terrain gen, new paintings, added classical music (i hate classical music), and some other random stuff they add</p>
    <p>ask me between reindev and bta, and i will <i>always</i> pick bta. why? because the features it adds are of high quality, it's active and fun, and has an actually decent community, all of which reindev doesn't quite have. the reason me and lexal played the mod is because he's been wanting to play it with me for a while, mainly because i know the most about the mod compared to him, and he just wanted to make fun of it. and we did. enjoy my new video (well, when it's finished)</p></div>
