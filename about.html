    <div class="main"><h3>ABOUT / FAQ</h3>
    <p>This is where you can find all the info about me you could ever mentally store (and plenty more).</p>
    <p>Info about me and the wacky stuff I do is on top, info about this site and how dated it looks is below.</p></div>
    
    <div class="secondary"><h3>INFO ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>Good morning. I'm LG (he/him), some kid who likes to make bad Scratch and IGM games in my freetime, often trying to balance gaming, game-making, and school.</p>
    <p>My proudest works include George 1 Remastered and The Lost Labyrinths, found in the <a href="games">Games</a> page.</p>
    <p>Now, what do I like? Well, I like Minecraft. I play it way, <i>way</i> too much. I also really like the movies Holes, Coraline, James and the Giant Peach, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</p>
    <p>Music? Well, my favorite artists are Tame Impala, MGMT, Beck, Bill Wurtz, GUM, Gorillaz, Arctic Monkeys, Tally Hall, and The Strokes. Also, I don't like rap and country music.</p></div>

    <div class="secondary"><h3>INFO ABOUT THIS SITE</h3>
    <p>This web site was made as a way for me to talk about <a href="blog">the stuff I talk to myself about</a> without having to make a million Scratch projects about it. I also get to add all sorts of fun details everywhere.</p>
    <p>The reason it doesn't look <i>nearly</i> as fancy as most modern websites is because I'm pretty mid when it comes to HTML and CSS, and I'm actively still getting used to their quirks.</p>
    <p>Oh yea, this website used to be hosted on Neocities. However, the CSS took forever to upload (it still does...?), and the file size was limited (albeit I'd probably never reach the limit).</p>
    <p>Also GitHub is just better</p></div>

    <div class="quaternary"><h3>NOT-VERY-FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
