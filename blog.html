    <div class="main"><h3>BLOG</h3>
      <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
      <p>You should expect 1-2 new posts every week. A <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a> post may come in-between.<br><b><a style="color:#8aab00;">Green</a></b> posts are about normal topics, <b><a style="color:#0005ab;">blue</a></b> posts are about emotional topics, <b><a style="color:#ab0000;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants.</p>

    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#b7d536;border:7px groove #d3e876;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">there is no easter bunny</a> / <i>3/31/2024</i> / <i>11:34 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
      <p>i wanna watch megamind (ONE) but streaming services make it so difficult for no reason</p>
      <p>today is easter day, which means it's a sunday. pretty cool, right? i think i'm supposed to go to a party, but my parents haven't yelled at me to get ready yet. to be fair, it was absolutely <i>pouring</i> last night so it might've gotten cancelled...? probably not, but eh, who cares. aside from that, today i want to record another video, but i don't know what i want to do. i'm thinking either another rhythm heaven or a video of me trying out the latest modern mc snapshot. i'll have to see</p>
      <p>while i think some sort of poll system would be pretty neat to have, i don't think it would help that much. this is mainly because i don't know how many people actually visit this website (at least enough to bother checking out this here blog), and i don't know <i>how</i> or <i>where</i> a poll would go. sure, youtube polls exist, but i wanna save those for special videos, and by "special videos" i really just mean i don't wanna use youtube polls all that often</p>
      <p>you might also wonder why this blog in particular uses lowercase text when the rest of this web site uses Uppercase text. sure, it might just be my laziness, but i like to consider this blog a more... "personal" side of this web site, so i like to write how i'd usually write if i was messaging someone online, that being lowercase with no periods at the end of my sentences. okay that last part is a bit of a lie, but if this blog was entirely run-on sentences, it would look like utter sh*t</p>
      <p>one more thing i'd like to mention while we're here; i'm catholic. so yeah, i believe in god and our mother mary and all that jazz, but i don't really uphold the traditions or anything like that. for example, i haven't gone to church in over 3 years, and i can't even remember that last time i said a prayer before dinner. while i do go to a catholic school, at this point i could really care less about my faith. religion as a whole is a mixed bag, and i'm a little on the negative side of that spectrum</p>
