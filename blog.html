      <p>hey look, i actually followed through with last week's promise</p>
      <p>good morning everyone. last was much less eventful than the week that came before it, so i guess i'll talk more about my current and upcoming projects. in case you're wondering whether Thirteen was the only album i'd ever make, you're dead wrong. at this very moment, i'm producing a <i>second</i> album, and it's called <b>The S</b>. there's only 6 complete songs on it right now, but i plan on having around 12-15 tracks packed into this new release. when will it come out? don't bother asking, because the answer won't be here for a while. a single or two may be released later</p>
      <p>in terms of game-making, production on Fire Forge has been picking up. i have lots of new ideas for some of the quests that are gonna be featured in the first alpha, and my pixel art skills are definitely improving, little by little. i know i said it would hopefully release mid-june, but if you haven't noticed, it's basically <i>late-june</i>. now the release has been delayed to When It's Ready™. i <i>will</i>, however, make a trailer for the game when i have enough gameplay to show. i'll probably also compose a song for said trailer, unless someone else makes it for me</p>
      <p>on another note, my previous IGM game, The Lost Labyrinths, was actually featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt_FEKCdapc">new video</a> by IronDizaster, a prominent member of the IGM community. i kinda wish the game wasn't in such an odd (and, well... kinda bad) state right now, but it is what it is, i guess. however, i'm still proud of that game and managing to make a game that rivals Forez's Dream (which was <i>also</i> shown in the same vid)</p>
      <p>as for the George series, i've been working on PLC (post-launch content, it wouldn't make sense to call it DLC) for George 1 Remastered. it'll add 3 new modes to play around with, those being <b>Level 6</b>, <b>Speedrun Mode</b>, and <b>Endless Mode</b>. i won't go in detail as to what they're all about, since i'd like you to experience those modes for yourself. i know it's been <i>over a year</i> since the game released, but "better late than never", as they say. in the meantime, i'll be releasing a project detailing some new stuff i've written and made for the lore of the series, which is going through some major overhauls and re-writes<br><q style="font-size:12px;color:#202020;">psst! the title of this post is actually the name of a song on the album i mentioned above!</q></p>
