      <p>the discs have been cancelled now, similar to me a couple months ago</p>
      <p><b>i have a bandcamp page</b> now! it'll host all future singles and albums i compose, including ones that've already been made. as for the <u>discs</u>, that complicates things. the <u>discs</u> were supposed to be some arg, which would reveal a story as more songs got released. however, i promised to make 10 of those things, which is quite beyond what i'm capable of, similar to how i planned out Sid's Adventure. so now i'm officially shutting down the discs (no more underlining), and all references and pages related to them have been deleted. the scratch account hosting them will be terminated soon</p>
      <p>i've already uploaded a few unreleased singles and the songs from the <i>Georg1e EP</i>, now renamed to <i>First Draft</i>. it also has a few more unreleased tracks that i made for the third disc. they're not good, but they are indeed there. however, i am working on a new <b>album</b> that will utilize the sweet sega genesis soundchip instead of the limited NES soundchip. a single will be uploaded later, hopefully within the day. until the album is complete (which shouldn't take long), i'll work on getting some more songs composed</p>
      <p>school is ending in seven days, which happens to be june 5th. my teachers are currently reviewing for our final exams, and the two i'm most worried about are algebra and spanish. when it comes to algebra, i'm pretty alright at it, but trying to actually <i>remember</i> the lessons is what gets me. i've mentioned before that school is just a glorified memory test, with extracurriculars thrown together on the side to make it seem "fun" and "enjoyable". that's bullsh*t. school is tedious, boring, and it makes me depressed. i can't stand the thought of having to put up with this crap for another three f***ing years</p>
      <p>okay... i'm losing focus. uh... so yeah, trying to remember the lessons i'm being taught is quite difficult, and algebra is no exception. as for spanish, i'm just not good at spanish. i hate to tell you this, but <i>no hablo en español</i>. don't try forcing it down my throat. also, the homework takes <i>forever</i> to do, which is why i have a feeling that 'B' i have isn't gonna last very long. these last few days are gonna make or break me</p>
      <p>welp, my monthly school rant is over. time for actually fun topics! i'm quite interested in <b>streaming on twitch</b>, which i'm sure i've said before. i'm looking into some tutorials and slightly better equipment (a stand-up mic) to get set up. what my first stream will consist of i'm not sure, but it'll probably just be some BTA gameplay or something. when it comes to G1.5 and SSMB, i'm dedicating my summer to developing them. while i probably won't finish them, i'll have enough time to make good progress and get farther than i've ever gotten before. in the meantime, i hope you enjoy what i'm putting out now, even if it doesn't seem like much</p>
