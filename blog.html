      <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
      <p>You should expect 1-2 new posts every week. A <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a> post may come in-between.<br><b><a style="color:#8aab00;">Green</a></b> posts are about normal topics, <b><a style="color:#0005ab;">blue</a></b> posts are about emotional topics, <b><a style="color:#ab0000;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants.</p>

      <p>seriously i'm gonna break down crying listening to these new songs man</p>
      <p>today i shove my music taste in your face by telling you that the new vampire weekend album is a goddamn masterpiece, i can't get enough of it. getting loss of life and only god was above us in the same year is truly a testament to how great these bands are. i'm actually going to see vampire weekend live in a few months, and i'm really excited to hear ice cream piano and capricorn destroy my eardrums. also i got the physical copy of the album day one, even though it took the store a while to process the order. overall, the album is a strong 9/10 imo</p>
      <p>even if you have absolutely no interest in this album, i strongly recommend you listen to at least one of its songs. (i suggest connect!) straying away from the musics, this spring break week was fairly eventful. first things first, i went to a theme park i like on tuesday, except this particular day was pretty mid. half the rides i actually enjoy were closed, and the lines for food were straight-up horrendous. my dad suggested we go back for round 2, but i'm still bummed from it</p>
      <p>on wednesday, i went to a hockey game with my dad. it was in los angeles, so the drive there was fairly long, not even taking into account the traffic. the game was honestly pretty great, and our team won with 
a score of 5-2. there weren't any real "fights", but there were a handful of little squabbles that got fans hyped. the drive home took even longer than it took to arrive, mainly because the streets of downtown LA are truly a horrifying and frightening experience. but who cares about the drive, the game was all that mattered, really</p>
      <p>i'm really grateful the album came out today, because i'm about to enter a small depression from having to go back to school. sometimes i wish i could just drop out and make cool games, but that's a pretty unrealistic way of thinking. i'm stuck in this garbage pit no matter what. i also watched NakeyJakey's video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8f_ezU2Tto"><i>High School Didn't Matter At All</i></a>, recently. while the video's tone is humorous, it really got me thinking. will HS help me later in life? or will it just be a lifeless prison filled with sh*tty schedules and boring classes?</p>
