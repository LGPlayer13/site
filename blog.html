      <p>the beginning of july is always the most eventful of the entire summer, for me at least</p>
      <p>hello everyone. this upcoming week is gonna be a <i>chore</i> to get through. i'm gonna be quite busy from wednesday all the way to saturday. not to mention, my parents now want me to really start working on my summer assignments because it's july. can i just say that summer assignments are possibly the dumbest and most frustratingly annoying thing that schools have ever forced upon students? their reasoning is that "oh these assignments are an <i>introduction</i> to the material, students <i>have to</i> learn them." no sane human being thinks that kids on summer break actually give a sh*t about learning stuff. the <b>entire</b> point of school is to <i>teach</i> you the concepts themselves, and not just pull drawn-out summer homework out of their ass.</p>
      <p>anyhoo, i finally released a new scratch project after... almost 4 months. it's a detailed update on the George Series lore and geography, which i explained would be heavily rewritten in the previous blog post. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1037737293/">here</a> is the project, and it will also be available in the <b>Lore & Stories</b> section of the <a href="games">Games</a> page. not the most impressive thing in the world, but you should at be happy i'm releasing <i>something</i> at this point. maybe i should join a game jam or something, that'd probably get my creative juices flowing again, which haven't flown for quite a long time now</p>
      <p>as for <b>The S</b>, progress has been relatively steady. there's currently 9 finished tracks so far, and i'm aiming for around 13 tracks on release. i will say that this album will be <i>quite</i> long, as just three of those tracks make up 11 minutes and 30 seconds! it'll probably clock in at around 30 minutes, rivaling actual albums made by real artists. (i don't call myself a "real" artist because, well, it's sega genesis music.) after this album releases within the next two weeks, i'll take a break from composing music to focus on making games. however, i've really enjoyed what i've been able to achieve in this side hobby of mine, even if the end result isn't anything amazing<br><q style="font-size:12px;color:#202020;">psst! i released a single a couple days ago! <a href="https://lgplayer13.bandcamp.com/track/schematics-2">here it is</a>!</q></p>
      <p>one thing i wish won't happen in the future is that these blog posts will end up just talking about the same three projects over and <i>over</i> again. for example, i've talked about my new album twice in a row now, and i get it can be a little tiresome for readers. yeah, it's <i>my</i> blog, so i can literally just ramble about nothing for as long as i desire, but it makes for repetitive blog posts and sluggish, boring reads. luckily for me, this week is gonna be <i>really</i> eventful, so my next post should be more unique and interesting than this one. in the meantime, have a good rest of your morning</p>
