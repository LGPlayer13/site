      <p>While this web site is typically used as a way to share my games, I also use it to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LGPlayer13">videos</a>, teasers, and <a href="blog">my thoughts</a>. Like most websites, this is the essential place to discover more about its creator and its projects.</p>
      <p>If you're here to get in contact with me, you can do that via my Discord server, found below the Navbar. Also, I won't be providing my email anywhere. Otherwise, have fun on my digital home on the world wide web.</p>

      <p>Now, what do I like? Well, I like Minecraft. I play it way, <i>way</i> too much. I also really like the movies Holes, Coraline, Elf, James and the Giant Peach, Home Alone 1 & 2, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Star Wars is also pretty epic.</p>
      <p>As for games in general, my favorites are Minecraft, Pizza Tower, Sound Shapes, Wii Sports, Rhythm Heaven, Baldi's Basics, Undertale, OMORI, and Stardew Valley. These games are pretty cool and fun, even though I haven't played some of them in a while.</p>
      <p>Music? Well, my favorite artists are Tame Impala, MGMT, Beck, Bill Wurtz, Vampire Weekend, Foster The People, and Radiohead. I also enjoy The Strokes, Gorillaz, Tally Hall, Pond, bo en, GUM, Arctic Monkeys, and TV Girl. If you'd like to recommend music for me to check out, feel free to via my <a href="socials">socials</a>.</p>
      <p>Favorite books? What are you talking about? I don't read, unless you count Diary of a Wimpy Kid.</p>
      <p>Other hobbies? Well, uh... I collect plushies. Yeah! I collect plushies, mainly of Minecraft mobs, but I also have a couple random ones. One of my prized plushies is Ross Federman, Tally Hall's drummer.</p>
      <p>Oh dang, there's still more room here. Well, how about every school grade ranked from best to worst? Here we go; 8th, Daycare, 2nd, 4th, 5th, Kindergarten, 6th, 9th, 1st, 7th, 3rd. Eighth grade was awesome, third grade sucked complete ass.</p>

    <div class="box" style="background:rgba(219,216,97,0.85);border:4px outset #e8e585;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #595716;">
      <p>This web site was made as a way for me to talk about random stuff I talk to myself about, mainly to avoid having to use a platform like X (formerly known as Twitter). I also get to add all sorts of fun details everywhere.</p>
      <p>The reason it doesn't look <i>nearly</i> as fancy or polished as most modern websites is because I'm just plain alright when it comes to HTML and CSS, and I'm actively still getting used to their quirks and limitations. Other languages I know are Scratch and IGM, but I'm not quite sure if these count.</p>
      <p>Oh yea, this web site used to be hosted on Neocities. However, the built-in editor wasn't great, and the file size was limited, albeit I'd probably never reach the cap. I know most websites like these are hosted on Neocities, but just know that I didn't make the switch to "stand out from the crowd" or anything.</p>
      <p>Also GitHub is just better</p>
