    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>You should expect new posts every 3-6 days. <a style="color:#b57c1e;">Short</a> posts may come in-between.<br><b><a style="color:#8aab00;">Green</a></b> posts are about normal topics, <b><a style="color:#0005ab;">blue</a></b> posts are about emotional topics, <b><a style="color:#ab0000;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants.</p></div>

    <div class="quinary" style="background-color:#ec3b3b;border:7px groove #ff8585;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #5c3434;"><h3><a style="color:#3e0000;">quantity over quality</a> / <i>3/6/2024</i> / <i>10:19 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#a100ff;">very long</a></h3>
    <p>felt like i should address this to the reindev community. boy, this is a <i>long</i> one<br>link to the post: <a href="reindev-response">ReIndev Response</a></p></div>
  
    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#caec3b;border:7px groove #e8ff85;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">down the dream</a> / <i>3/3/2024</i> / <i>3:32 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>sometimes i remembers the times when i actually <i>wanted</i> to make games and write stories. nowdays, not so much</p>
    <p>back when i joined scratch in 2020, i had so many cool ideas for games i wanted to make. some of them included <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/415125595/">Two-Player Ball Wars</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/485819865/">George 1</a>, and some others. i absolutely adored these when they were finished, and for good reason; i was proud of them. looking back, these games are nothing special (especially) ball wars, but i still remember when i cared about making them and never missed a beat. today, i'm quite the procrastinator, and i'm also very lazy about everything.</p>
    <p>my latest work came out <i>6 months ago</i>, and for scratch that's not great. sure, the Remastered Collection is gonna release today, and by today i mean like at 10 pm, probably. i've lost most of my motivation to make games, both on scratch and igm. all i do now is watch youtube and play minecraft, working on my projects every once in while. i <i>want</i> to see these projects completed, but i've lost all intent to sit down and make a game again. the worst part is wanting to work on a game, but are forced to work on another because of a deadline or something.</p>
    <p>now you're probably wondering; "why did you even bother setting a deadline for the Remastered Collection?" well, i wanted to make a cool trailer with a song i liked. and i did, not realising that i <i>didn't</i> have to put a deadline, as i could've just put 'coming soon' and set a release date later. but that would've started another problem; i'd never work on the game without something pushing me to work on it. sure, the trailer is there, but it'd make me want to work on the game <i>less</i>, since i'd just be like "oh the trailer is out, now i can wait a while for people to get hyped for it or something"</p>
    <p>to be fair, i'm not doing <i>nothing</i> in the meantime. i've spent a lot of time on projects like <b>this website</b>, not including the <u>discs</u>. i've also been working on my youtube channel, making videos like the <a href="https://youtu.be/sfnnvhjYcQc">Making Fun of ReIndev With Lexal</a> video, with its sequel coming out in a few days! and no, i'm not doing youtube full-time, it's going to remain a hobby. hopefully my mood picks up and i get can back into the swing of things.</p></div>
