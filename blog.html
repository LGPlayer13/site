    <div class="longersecondary" style="background-color:#caec3b;border:7px groove #e8ff85;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">re-hash</a> / <i>4/14/2024</i> / <i>11:51 AM PST</i> / <a style="color:#1eb584;">longer</a></h3>
      <p>the web site looks different, so now i'm going to file a noise complaint</p>
      <p>good morning every one. after doing lots of thinking and back-and-forth-ing, i've decided to move to Brackets for future web site development. to learn why, read <a href="devlog2">this</a>. now that the web site has updating to version 1.2 in the span of less than three days, i should probably run you through what's been changed, removed, and added. alright time for professional moment: <i>i think this new update will provide a smoother browsing experience for all of our viewers and loyal subscribers, as this company is strictly satisfaction-oriented</i></p>
      <p>first things first, the little bar below the Navbar (the one with the all the icons) has been removed in favor of the <a href="socials">Socials</a> page. i've been thinking that the little bar looks ugly for a while now, so i'm glad it's been trashed. next up, <i>most</i> of the gray boxes containing information for each page have been removed and replaced with tinier bars that get straight to the point- the title of the page. this web site used to use the color gray waaaay to much, so i'm glad to make this web site more colorful and lively</p>
      <p>the Updates page no longer uses plain text for every update, but instead every major project/web site update will have its own neat box (with an icon!) that quickly tells you what's new. each one will even have its own <b>devlog</b> linked with it! minor updates will get their own box, too, but they won't have an icon or devlog, sadly. the Socials page also uses a similar system, but instead of linking you to a devlog, they just send you to their respective websites</p>
      <p>as for removed stuff, the Blog-3, Cory Lore, CSS Previewing, George Lore, and Youtube Channel pages have all been terminated. some of these pages were outdated and useless, some were just plain useless, and one of them was a new employee that didn't fit well with the others. every other page has been saved and updated, but you might find them in different spots. you probably didn't even know some of those pages existed, and i'm not sure why i kept them for so long</p>
      <p>alright, enough web site blabber. it's time for actual blog talking. school hasn't been as bad as i thought it would be, except for the part where literally <i>everything important</i> occurs when i'm at school. that's the nicest part. as for game development, george 1.5 development has slowed down a bit, but i plan to get things done when monday comes around. that might even include a new <b>teaser trailer</b> for you all to see what the game actually looks and plays like! i'm super excited to show this new engine to you all, as i'm extremely proud of what's been cooking<br>lex has also been cooking up g1.5's soundtrack, and i think it sounds pretty great. we have a neat idea for a soundtrack project that we mentioned in the Terraria 1.0.6.4 video, but i'm not sure when that'll come to fruition. we <i>could</i> make it now, but we should probably work on the actual game, first. plus, the soundtrack isn't even done yet. while it might take a while, i <i>promise</i> i'll get this game released. i'd love to say by the end of 2024, but i'm not setting <i>any</i> deadlines for myself</p>
