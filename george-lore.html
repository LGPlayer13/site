    <p>STORY : Part 1</p>
    <p>George was born on the planet of Crison, only his mother being with him at birth. His father divorced his mother a week after George was born due to mistrust and guilt. George's father took most of their money and ran off to an unknown location. The mother had a hard time taking care of George, especially considering the fact that her eldest son, Gregory, had been reported missing for a few days.</p></div>
    <div class="secondary"><h3>Page 5 out of 8</i></h3>
    <p>STORY : Part 2</p>
    <p>With all this, George's early life was difficult. He was harassed at school for his poor posture and odd behavior, causing him to often run away from school and develop a serious depression. One one particularly awful day, George took out all of his built-up rage on one of his bullies, causing him to be expelled from the school due to the corrupt administration.</p>
    <p>George's mother had used most of the remaining money to send him to school, so she left George on the streets after realizing her money had gone to waste.</p></div>
    <div class="secondary"><h3>Page 6 out of 8</i></h3>
    <p>STORY : Part 3</p>
    <p>George made his way home using his measly geographic knowledge, and his mother was petrified at the sight of his son at the front door.</p>
    <p>She had kicked her own son out once, and she did it again, but this time she had forced him off the planet.</p>
    <p>George fled to Planet Swaqon, where he had nothing to guide him or help him. He was only 9 at the time, and he knew almost nothing about survival in pure nature. George survived in the shadows of civilization, mainly from stealing and trickery. (He also developed decent pickpocketing skills.)</p></div>
    <div class="secondary"><h3>Page 7 out of 8</i></h3>
    <p>STORY : Part 4</p>
    <p>After a couple years, George was scavaging through a forest when he noticed a blue triangle lying on the side of rock, injured. He instantly recognized the triangle as Greg, his long-lost brother. The two quickly bonded and helped each other out.</p>
     <p>However, the meeting wouldn't last long, as a shadowy figure emerged from behind a tree and shot Greg with a syringe containing a blue liquid. Greg was paralyzed, and his body was slowly corrupting with a strange disease. George wanted to help, but he was forced to run away, leaving Greg alone in the forest.</p></div>
    <div class="secondary"><h3>Page 8 out of 8</i></h3>
    <p>STORY : Part 5</p>
    <p>It was another many years before George encountered Greg again, but this meeting was different. Greg was in the middle of terrorizing a small town before George entered the scene. Greg saw him and started to chase him into the sky.</p>
    <p>George tried to get away, but his brother had turned evil with a dark blue to go along with it. Dark magic was used to smite George out of the sky, ending with him crashing into the Rocky Hillside. This would start what is now known as George 1...</p></div>
