    <p>This blog post will work a little differently.<br>(it's divided into chunks)</p></div>

    <p><i>"like thanks for shitting on my work and making a video on it instead of just talking to me about what issues you have wit hthe mod or making suggestions for it"</i></p>
    <p>mate, we're not <i>shitting</i> on your work. the video literally has the words "Making Fun Of ReIndev" in its title. in case you couldn't tell, this video is meant to be <i>humorous</i>. (and no, i don't care whether you found it funny or not, that doesn't matter)</p>
    <p>i don't use any "proper" editing software, i just use youtube's built-in editor to trim the footage a bit, but i wanna be a bit more rambunctious this time. what i mean by that is editing in music, <s>transitions</s>, even more jump-cuts, stuff like that, because a nearly two-hour-long video of two idiots building a house in a dead reindev server doesn't sound that exciting on paper</p>
    <p>i might as well give my thoughts on reindev while we're here. the mod is just ok; it runs fine, it looks like sh*t, and it has a more quantity-over-quality approach with all of the janky stuff it adds. the stuff i <i>do</i> like is the ambience. that's it. anyways, the stuff i <i>don't</i> like includes the "overhauled" nether, constant lighting issues, odd community, potions, terrain gen, new painting system, wendigos, added classical music (i hate classical music), and some other random stuff they add</p>
    <p>ask me between reindev and bta, and i will <i>always</i> pick bta. why? because the features it adds are of high quality, it's active and fun, and has an actually decent community, all of which reindev doesn't quite have. the reason me and lexal played the mod is because he's been wanting to play it with me for a while, mainly because i know the most about the mod compared to him, and he just wanted to make fun of it. and we did. enjoy my new video (well, when it's finished)</p></div>
