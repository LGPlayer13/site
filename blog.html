    <p>Good morning. This is the place where I rant about whatever I'm doing, or if I just wanna vent.</p>
    <p>You should expect 1-2 new posts every week. A <a style="color:#b57c1e;">short</a> post may come in-between.<br><b><a style="color:#8aab00;">Green</a></b> posts are about normal topics, <b><a style="color:#0005ab;">blue</a></b> posts are about emotional topics, <b><a style="color:#ab0000;">red</a></b> posts are angry rants.</p></div>

    <div class="longsecondary" style="background-color:#b7d536;border:7px groove #d3e876;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px #545c34;"><h3><a style="color:#323e00;">reality in motion</a> / <i>3/25/2024</i> / <i>12:26 PM PST</i> / <a style="color:#8ab51e;">long</a></h3>
    <p>lgamemaker13 actually making games? this is so unexpected and unbelievable</p>
    <p>recently, i've been feeling down because i never work on any of my important projects anymore, the George series especially. however, lexal and i have been in several discord calls where we both unanymously agreed that i have a problem. he decided to pull my ass out of its slumber and get george 1.5 development back on track. since the story has already been wrapped up, my main priority is level design, which has been fairly slow, but it's going well so far, so that's good</p>
    <p>lex is also composing a bunch of <i>cool music</i> for the game, and he's basically already done with the main soundtrack, aside from a couple tracks. i actually updated the LG Productions Presentation to include level 1's track. an ost project may come out some time to give you an idea of what we're cooking up, but i'll have to double-check with lex about that. until then, just know that development <i>is happening</i> and more news will come soon, hopefully. also, <b>no deadlines</b></p>
    <p>another thing that's happened is i started playing tomodachi life again! (guess who inspired me to do that.) if you don't know, tomodachi life (tomodachi means "friend" in japanese) is a neat 3DS game where you build up an island with a bunch of little custom characters called Miis. you talk to them, feed them, play stupid games with them, and even see them interact and become friends. i got the game when i was like, 5, so it's cool to start over and see how i do</p>
    <p>i know i said that the NSSS video would come out two days ago, but the server we were playing on apparently got griefed, despite there being literally nothing to grief on there. the owner shut the server down for maintenence or something, so we're waiting on that to fix itself. however, i <i>do</i> still wanna make that rhythm heaven video i mentioned, i just have to find a very legal way to play and obtain and record the game on my compu- i mean 2DS. also yes, i own a 2DS. the thing is 11 years old and still runs fairly well, despite some occassional top screen flickering</p></div>
